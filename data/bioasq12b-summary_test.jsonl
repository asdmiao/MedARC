{"context":"Based on molecular aberrations, in particular the NPM1 mutation (NPM1(mut)) and the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD), prognostic subgroups have been defined among patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype. Whereas these subgroups are known to play an important role in outcome in first complete remission, and also in the indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, data are limited on their role after transplantation in advanced disease. To evaluate the role of molecular subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype after allogeneic stem cell transplantation beyond first complete remission, we analyzed the data from 141 consecutive adults (median age: 51.0 years, range 18.4-69.3 years) who had received an allogeneic transplant either in primary induction failure or beyond first complete remission. A sequential regimen of cytoreductive chemotherapy (fludarabine, high-dose AraC, amsacrine) followed by reduced intensity conditioning (FLAMSA-RIC), was uniformly used for conditioning. After a median follow up of three years, overall survival from transplantation was 64 \u00b1 4%, 53 \u00b1 4% and 44 \u00b1 5% at one, two and four years, respectively. Forty patients transplanted in primary induction failure achieved an encouraging 2-year survival of 69%. Among 101 patients transplanted beyond first complete remission, 2-year survival was 81% among patients with the NPM1(mut)\/FLT3(wt) genotype in contrast to 43% in other genotypes. Higher numbers of transfused CD34(+) cells (hazard ratio 2.155, 95% confidence interval 0.263-0.964, P=0.039) and favorable genotype (hazard ratio 0.142, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.898, P=0.048) were associated with superior overall survival in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype can frequently be rescued after primary induction failure by allogeneic transplantation following FLAMSA-RIC.

{"context":"Eukaryotic gene fusion and fission events are mechanistically more complicated than in prokaryotes, and their quantitative contributions to genome evolution are still poorly understood. We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana. Out of 10,172 orthologous gene pairs, 60 (0.6% of the total) revealed a verified fusion or fission event in either lineage after the divergence of O. sativa and A. thaliana. Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. Nucleotide insertion bias has promoted gene fission in the O. sativa lineage, consistent with its generally longer nucleotide sequences than A. thaliana in selectively neutral regions, and with the abundance of transposable elements in rice. The divergence time of monocots and dicots (140-200 Myr) indicates that gene fusion\/fission events occur at an average rate of 1x10(-11) to 2x10(-11) events per gene per year, approximately 100-fold slower than the average per site nuclear nucleotide substitution rate in these lineages. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results.","question":"Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?","answer":"We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana"}

Periostin participates in normal physiological activities such as cardiac development, but is also involved in pathophysiological processes in vascular diseases, wound repair, bone formation, and tumor development. It is of increasing interest in tumor biology because it is frequently overexpressed in a variety of epithelial carcinomas and is functionally involved in multiple steps of metastasis progression. These include the maintenance of stemness, niche formation, EMT, the survival of tumor cells, and angiogenesis, all of which are indispensable for gastric cancer metastasis. Periostin has been reported to activate the PI-3K\/AKT, Wnt, and FAK-mediated signaling pathways to promote metastasis. Therefore, periostin represents a potentially promising candidate for the inhibition of metastasis. In this review article, we summarize recent advances in knowledge concerning periostin, its antagonist PNDA-3, and their influence on such key processes in cancer metastasis as maintenance of stemness, niche formation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, tumor cell survival, and angiogenesis.

{"context":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a life-shortening X-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive wasting and weakening of muscles in boys. Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping.

We previously found that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which contain \u226520 carbons, accumulate during necroptosis. Here, we show that genetic knockdown of Fatty Acid (FA) Elongase 7 (ELOVL7) reduces accumulation of specific very long chain FAs during necroptosis, resulting in reduced necroptotic cell death and membrane permeabilization. Conversely, increasing the expression of ELOVL7 increases very long chain fatty acids and membrane permeabilization. , introduction of the VLCFA C24 FA disrupts bilayer integrity in liposomes to a greater extent than a conventional C16 FA. To investigate the microscopic origin of these observations, atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. MD simulations suggest that fatty acids cause clear differences in bilayers based on length and that it is the interdigitation of C24 FA between the individual leaflets that results in disorder in the region and, consequently, membrane disruption. We synthesized clickable VLCFA analogs and observed that many proteins were acylated by VLCFAs during necroptosis.

Urine specimens from 11 patients with this disorder were examined for HA by a novel high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. In patients with progeria, HA excretion ranged from 169 micrograms HA\/g creatinine to 1440 micrograms HA\/g creatinine. In normal age-matched controls, HA excreted ranged from 0 to 77 micrograms HA\/g creatinine. In all, a mean 17-fold increase in HA excretion was observed in patients with progeria when compared with age-matched normal controls. Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion was not elevated.

We isolated primary epididymal epithelial cells from rat epididymides and verified their phenotype by detecting the presence of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19, an epithelial cell marker) and the absence vimentin (an interstitial cell marker). We found that cultured epididymal epithelial cells isolated from rat epididymides expressed high levels of CK-19 but barely expressed vimentin. Gain-of-function assays, which included the CCK-8 assay and EdU flow cytometry assay, indicated that overexpression of OCTN2 significantly promoted epididymal epithelial cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, forced expression of OCTN2 inhibited the cell apoptosis process, and at the same time increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factor BAX, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptosis factors BCL-2 and Survivin. Furthermore, we also found that OCTN2 overexpression dramatically increased the levels of biomarkers associated with spermatogenesis, including azoospermia-like (DAZL), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), and protamine 2 (PRM2).

{"context":"The Mediator complex serves a crucial function in gene regulation, forming a link between gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Most protein-coding genes therefore require Mediator complex activity for transcriptional regulation. Given the essential functions performed by Mediator complex proteins in gene regulation, it is not surprising that mutations in Mediator complex genes disrupt animal and plant development. What is more intriguing is that the phenotypes of individual Mediator complex mutants are distinct from each other, demonstrating that certain developmental processes have a greater requirement for specific Mediator complex genes. Additionally, the range of developmental processes that are altered in Mediator complex mutants is broad, affecting a variety of cell types and physiological systems. Gene expression defects in Mediator complex mutants reveal distinct roles for individual Mediator proteins in transcriptional regulation, suggesting that the deletion of one Mediator complex protein does not interfere with transcription in general, but instead alters the expression of specific target genes. Mediator complex proteins may have diverse roles in different organisms as well, as mutants in the same Mediator gene in different species can display dissimilar phenotypes.","question":"What is the role of the Mediator in gene expression?","answer":"The Mediator complex serves a crucial function in gene regulation, forming a link between gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II."}

Birds and mammals utilize common signaling molecules but some molecules possess different\/opposite functions. If relevant, particular differences with the mammalian regulatory system are highlighted in this review. For example, obestatin had no significant effect on feed intake of chicks, but it was claimed to decrease food intake in mammalian species. Ghrelin displayed appetite-stimulating effects in mammals but appetite-decreasing effects in birds. Recently, the function of the hypothalamic AMPK signaling pathway on feed intake regulation has received considerable attention in poultry. Alpha-lipoic acid might exert its appetite-decreasing effect by the AMPK signaling pathway.

{"context":"The kisspeptin system, a known regulator of reproduction in fish, was investigated during two key phases within the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) life cycle: protandrous sex change and larval ontogeny. Seabream specific partial cDNA sequences were identified for two key targets, kissr4 and kiss2, which were subsequently cloned and qPCR assays developed. Thereafter, to examine association in expression with sex change, a group of adult seabream (2+ years old) undergoing sex change were sampled for gene expression at two different periods of the annual cycle. To study the kisspeptin system ontogeny during early life stages, transcript levels were monitored in larvae (till 30\u00a0days-post-hatch, DPH) and post-larvae (from 30 till 140 DPH). During sex change, higher expression of kissr4 and kiss2 was observed in males when compared to females or individual undergoing sex change, this is suggestive of differential actions of the kisspeptin system during protandrous sex change. Equally, variable expression of the kisspeptin system during early ontogenic development was observed. The higher expression of kissr4 and kiss2 observed from 5 DPH, with elevations at 5-20 and 90 DPH for kissr4 and at 5, 10, 20, and 60 DPH for kiss2, is coincident with the early ontogeny of gnrh genes previously reported for seabream, and possibly related with early development of the reproductive axis in this species.","question":"What is the function of kisspeptin in the brain?","answer":"The kisspeptin system, a known regulator of reproduction in fish,"}

In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the effects of testosterone on the AVT system in male and female tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus, and to determine whether AVT is related to territorial aggression in this species. Tree lizards are a free-living species that exhibit natural hormonal fluctuations across breeding seasons. We detected a male-biased sexual dimorphism in centrally projecting AVT fibers within the limbic system. Furthermore, changes with season, reproductive state, and hormonal treatment suggest that testosterone regulates AVT immunoreactivity in limbic brain regions, especially in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Testosterone also affects AVT immunoreactivity in peripherally projecting cell clusters, as well as the size of AVT cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus.

{"context":"Naive and primed pluripotency is characterized by distinct signaling requirements, transcriptomes, and developmental properties, but both cellular states share key transcriptional regulators: Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Here, we demonstrate that transition between these two pluripotent states is associated with widespread Oct4 relocalization, mirrored by global rearrangement of enhancer chromatin landscapes. Our genomic and biochemical analyses identified candidate mediators of primed state-specific Oct4 binding, including Otx2 and Zic2\/3. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. However, the ability of Otx2 to engage new enhancer regions is determined by its levels, cis-encoded properties of the sites, and the signaling environment.

In this study, we evaluated a WM-sensor for reverse ABO blood typing. Since reverse ABO blood typing is a method for detection of antibodies against type A and type B oligosaccharide antigens on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs), we fixed a synthetic type A or type B trisaccharide antigen on the sensor chip of the WM sensor. We obtained significant changes in the reflectance spectra from a WM sensor on type A antigen with type B plasma and type O plasma and on type B antigen with type A plasma and type O plasma, and no spectrum changes on type A antigen or type B antigen with type AB plasma. Signal enhancement with the addition of a peroxidase reaction failed to increase the sensitivity for detection on oligosaccharide chips.

{"context":"Cancer cells can obtain their ability to invade and metastasise by undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Exploiting this mechanism of cellular plasticity, malignant cells can remodel their actin cytoskeleton and down-regulate proteins needed for cell-cell contacts. The mechanisms of cytoskeletal reorganisation resulting in mesenchymal morphology and increased invasive potential are poorly understood. Actin nucleating formins have been implicated as key players in EMT. Here, we analysed which formins are altered in squamous cell carcinoma related EMT. FHOD1, a poorly studied formin, appeared to be markedly upregulated upon EMT. In human tissues FHOD1 was primarily expressed in mesenchymal cells, with little expression in epithelia. However, specimens from oral squamous cell cancers demonstrated consistent FHOD1 upregulation in mesenchymally transformed cells at the invasive edge. This upregulation was confirmed in an oral squamous carcinoma model, where FHOD1 expression was markedly increased upon EMT in a PI3K signalling dependent manner. In the EMT cells FHOD1 contributed to the spindle-shaped morphology and mesenchymal F-actin organization. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that FHOD1 contributes to cell migration and invasion. Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix. Our results indicate that FHOD1 participates in cytoskeletal changes in EMT.

{"context":"TAL1 is a critical transcription factor required for hematopoiesis. However, perturbation of its activity often leads to T cell leukemia. Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region.

{"context":"The quantitation of lysine post-translational modifications (PTMs) by bottom-up mass spectrometry is convoluted by the need for analogous derivatives and the production of different tryptic peptides from the unmodified and modified versions of a protein. Chemical derivatization of lysines prior to enzymatic digestion circumvents these problems and has proven to be a successful method for lysine PTM quantitation. The most notable example is the use of deuteroacetylation to quantitate lysine acetylation. In this work, levels of lysine ubiquitination were quantitated using a structurally homologous label that is chemically similar to the diglycine (GlyGly) tag, which is left at the ubiquitination site upon trypsinolysis. The LC-MS analysis of a chemically equivalent monoglycine (Gly) tag that is analogous to the corresponding GlyGly tag proved that the monoglycine tag can be used for the quantitation of ubiquitination. A glycinylation protocol was then established for the derivatization of proteins to label unmodified lysine residues with a single glycine tag. Ubiquitin multimers were used to show that after glycinylation and tryptic digestion, the mass spectrometric response from the corresponding analogous tagged peptides could be compared for relative quantitation. For a proof of principle regarding the applicability of this technique to the analysis of ubiquitination in biological samples, the glycinylation technique was used to quantitate the increase in monoubiquitinated histone H2B that is observed in yeast which lacks the enzyme responsible for deubiquitinating H2B-K123, compared to wild-type yeast.","question":"Which is the mass-tag that reveal the ubiquitination of a lysine residue?","answer":"In this work, levels of lysine ubiquitination were quantitated using a structurally homologous label that is chemically similar to the diglycine (GlyGly) tag, which is left at the ubiquitination site upon trypsinolysis"}
{"context":"Previous studies showed that a Bacillus subtilis strain deficient in mismatch repair (MMR; encoded by the mutSL operon) promoted the production of stationary-phase-induced mutations. However, overexpression of the mutSL operon did not completely suppress this process, suggesting that additional DNA repair mechanisms are involved in the generation of stationary-phase-associated mutants in this bacterium. In agreement with this hypothesis, the results presented in this work revealed that starved B. subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants. These results strongly suggest that the occurrence of mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species in nondividing cells of B. subtilis having an inactive GO system. Interestingly, overexpression of the MMR system significantly diminished the accumulation of mutations in cells deficient in the GO repair system during stationary phase. These results suggest that the MMR system plays a general role in correcting base mispairing induced by oxidative stress during stationary phase. Thus, the absence or depression of both the MMR and GO systems contributes to the production of stationary-phase mutants in B. subtilis.

{"context":"A common process during preimplantation mammalian development is blastocyst formation, which utilizes signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), yet the mechanisms through which FGFR2 signaling affect preimplantation development in bovine embryos remain incompletely understood. Here, we used RNA-interference to investigate the in vitro development, the frequency of blastomere apoptosis, and the mRNA expression of developmental marker genes in FGF receptor 2-knockdown (FGFR2-KD) bovine embryos. A reduction in FGFR2 mRNA did not affect preimplantation development or the frequency of apoptotic blastomeres, but did enhanced proliferation of the inner cell mass in blastocysts (P\u2009<\u20090.05)-which differs from the phenotype reported for bovine embryos using a pharmacological approach (treatment with the pan-FGFR blocker PD173074), but agrees with previous results obtained using mouse embryos. Moreover, the expression of an epiblast marker gene, NANOG, and a primitive endoderm marker gene, GATA6, remained unchanged, whereas the expression of another primitive endoderm marker gene, HNF4A, was significantly reduced in FGFR2-KD embryos. Therefore, FGFR2 signaling appears to be associated with the regulation of inner cell mass development and proliferation during blastocyst formation in cattle. Mol. Reprod.

{"context":"The search for the etiologic agents of periodontal diseases started in the Golden Era of medical bacteriology, when the etiologic agents of many bacterial infections were isolated and characterized. After the initial enthusiasm in establishing the infectious nature and the true agents of periodontal diseases, this concept was virtually ignored for the next four decades. Until the early 1970s treatment regimens based on the non-specific plaque hypothesis were directed towards a non-specific reduction in plaque amount. Later, the specific plaque hypothesis established the role of some microorganisms such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in different forms of periodontal diseases. It was recently suggested that these suspected periodontal pathogens seem to not act alone and interactions between species, especially the balance between pathogenic and beneficial species affect both progression of disease and response of tissues to periodontal therapy. Nowadays it is well established that one of the goals of therapy is to control such periodontal pathogens. Among the most commonly used therapies to treat periodontal infections are scaling and root planing (SRP), supragingival plaque control and periodontal surgeries. Many studies confirmed the reduction of \"red complex\" species by SRP, and apically repositioned flap can lead to an additional beneficial effect in the subgingival microbiota by decreasing levels of \"red\" and \"orange complexes\" species. Furthermore, the level of plaque control maintained by the patients has been considered a crucial step in preventing recurrence of destructive periodontitis.","question":"Which types of bacterial microflora are associated with the progression of peri-implantitis?","answer":" Later, the specific plaque hypothesis established the role of some microorganisms such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in different forms of periodontal diseases"}
{"context":"Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases. The closest known relative of P. falciparum is a chimpanzee parasite, Plasmodium reichenowi, of which one single isolate was previously known. The co-speciation hypothesis suggests that both parasites evolved separately from a common ancestor over the last 5-7 million years, in parallel with the divergence of their hosts, the hominin and chimpanzee lineages. Genetic analysis of eight new isolates of P. reichenowi, from wild and wild-born captive chimpanzees in Cameroon and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, shows that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite. The genetic lineage comprising the totality of global P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. This finding is inconsistent with the co-speciation hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all extant P. falciparum populations originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single host transfer, which may have occurred as early as 2-3 million years ago, or as recently as 10,000 years ago. The evolutionary history of this relationship may be explained by two critical genetic mutations. First, inactivation of the CMAH gene in the human lineage rendered human ancestors unable to generate the sialic acid Neu5Gc from its precursor Neu5Ac, and likely made humans resistant to P. reichenowi. More recently, mutations in the dominant invasion receptor EBA 175 in the P. falciparum lineage provided the parasite with preference for the overabundant Neu5Ac precursor, accounting for its extreme human pathogenicity.","question":"Which is the causative agent of malaria?","answer":"Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases"}

{"context":"Some patients with nickel (Ni) allergic contact dermatitis suffer from systemic (intestinal or cutaneous) symptoms after ingestion of Ni-rich foods and experience symptoms reduction with low-Ni diet, a condition termed Systemic Ni Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). We aimed at evaluating whether oral administration of low nickel doses improved clinical conditions and modulated immunological aspects of SNAS, without significant side effects. Thirty-six SNAS patients were enrolled. Treatment started after 1-month of low-Ni diet and consisted in an incremental oral NiOH dose phase (0.3ng to 1.5 microg\/week) followed by a 12-months maintenance phase (1.5 microg\/week). Randomly, twenty-four patients added Ni therapy to low-Ni diet and 12 remained with diet alone. All patients were allowed rescue medications (antihistamines and topical steroids). After 4 months, Ni-rich foods were gradually reintroduced. In vitro allergen-driven IL13, IL5 and IFN-gamma release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated before and after treatment. Twenty-three patients receiving NiOH and the 12 control patients completed the study. Evaluation of SNAS clinical severity (by VAS and drug consumption) showed a significant difference in favor of NiOH-treated patients compared to controls. Twenty of 23 patients in the NiOH group and none in the control group tolerated Ni-rich food reintroduction. Release of all studied cytokines in culture supernatants was significantly lower after NiOH treatment. In conclusion NiOH is effective in reducing symptoms and drug consumption in SNAS and is able to modulate inflammatory parameters.","question":"What is the systemic nickel allergy syndrome?","answer":"Some patients with nickel (Ni) allergic contact dermatitis suffer from systemic (intestinal or cutaneous) symptoms after ingestion of Ni-rich foods and experience symptoms reduction with low-Ni diet, a condition termed Systemic Ni Allergy Syndrome (SNAS)"}

It has not been known to occur due to an extracranially originated posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), the first case of which we present herein. A 71-year-old man presented with reproducible dizziness on leftward head rotation, indicative of BHS. On radiographic examination, the bilateral VAs merged into the basilar artery, and the left VA was predominant. The right PICA originated extracranially from the right VA at the atlas-axis level and ran vertically into the spinal canal. During the head rotation that induced dizziness, the right PICA was occluded, and a VA stenosis was revealed. Occlusion of the PICA was considered to be the primary cause of the dizziness. The patient underwent surgery to decompress the right PICA and VA  a posterior cervical approach. Following surgery, the patient's dizziness disappeared, and the stenotic change at the right VA and PICA improved.

{"context":"In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +\/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and\/or Tg antibodies (TgAb) above 350 IU\/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in TPOAb concentrations. Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality of life estimation. Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody (TPOAb)-matched groups; 36 patients received 200 microg (2.53 micromol) sodium selenite\/d, orally, for 3 months, and 34 patients received placebo. All patients were substituted with L-T(4) to maintain TSH within the normal range. TPOAb, TgAb, TSH, and free thyroid hormones were determined by commercial assays. The echogenicity of the thyroid was monitored with high resolution ultrasound. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly to 63.6% (P = 0.013) in the selenium group vs. 88% (P = 0.95) in the placebo group. A subgroup analysis of those patients with TPOAb greater than 1200 IU\/ml revealed a mean 40% reduction in the selenium-treated patients compared with a 10% increase in TPOAb in the placebo group. TgAb concentrations were lower in the placebo group at the beginning of the study and significantly further decreased (P = 0.018), but were unchanged in the selenium group. Nine patients in the selenium-treated group had completely normalized antibody concentrations, in contrast to two patients in the placebo group (by chi(2) test, P = 0.01). Ultrasound of the thyroid showed normalized echogenicity in these patients. The mean TSH, free T(4), and free T(3) levels were unchanged in both groups. We conclude that selenium substitution may improve the inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, especially in those with high activity. Whether this effect is specific for autoimmune thyroiditis or may also be effective in other endocrine autoimmune diseases has yet to be investigated.","question":"Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?","answer":"Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."}
{"context":"An hypothesis for melanoma induction is presented: UV radiation absorbed by melanin in melanocytes generates products that may activate the carcinogenic process. Products formed by UV absorption in the upper layers of the epidermis cannot diffuse down as far as to the melanocytes. Thus, melanin in the upper layer of the skin may be protective, while that in melanocytes may be photocarcinogenic. Observations that support this hypothesis include: (1) Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. (2) Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. (3) Among sun-sensitive, poorly tanning persons, frequent UV exposures are associated with increased risk of melanoma, whereas among sun-resistant, well-tanning persons, increased frequency of exposure is associated with decreased melanoma risk. (4) It is likely that UVA, being absorbed by melanin, might have a melanoma-inducing effect. This is in agreement with some epidemiological investigations which indicate that sun-screen lotions may not protect sufficiently against melanoma induction. The relative latitude gradient for UVA is much smaller than that for UVB. The same is true for the relative latitude gradient of cutaneous malignant melanoma as compared with squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Under the assumption that the average slopes of the curves relating incidence rates with fluences of carcinogenic UV radiation are similar for melanomas and nonmelanomas, these facts are in agreement with the assumption that UVA plays a significant role in the induction of melanomas in humans. This is in agreement with the experimental results with Xiphophorus.","question":"Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?","answer":"Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas.

{"context":"Selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins via \"recoding\" of UGA from a stop codon to a sense codon, a process that requires specific secondary structures in the 3' untranslated region, termed selenocysteine incorporation sequence (SECIS) elements, and the protein factors that they recruit. Whereas most selenoprotein mRNAs contain a single UGA codon and a single SECIS element, selenoprotein P genes encode multiple UGAs and two SECIS elements. We have identified evolutionary adaptations in selenoprotein P genes that contribute to the efficiency of incorporating multiple selenocysteine residues in this protein. The first is a conserved, inefficiently decoded UGA codon in the N-terminal region, which appears to serve both as a checkpoint for the presence of factors required for selenocysteine incorporation and as a \"bottleneck,\" slowing down the progress of elongating ribosomes. The second adaptation involves the presence of introns downstream of this inefficiently decoded UGA which confer the potential for nonsense-mediated decay when factors required for selenocysteine incorporation are limiting. Third, the two SECIS elements in selenoprotein P mRNA function with differing efficiencies, affecting both the rate and the efficiency of decoding different UGAs. The implications for how these factors contribute to the decoding of multiple selenocysteine residues are discussed.","question":"Which is the human selenoprotein that contains several Se-Cys residues?","answer":"selenoprotein P genes encode multiple UGAs and two SECIS elements"}

Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24\u2009h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes.

These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

In many cancer types, among which breast cancer, prognostic and\/or predictive values have been suggested for both PD-1 and PD-L1. Previous research has demonstrated discrepancies in PD-L1 expression between primary breast tumors and distant metastases, however data so far have been scarce. We therefore evaluated immunohistochemical expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in primary breast tumors and their paired distant metastases, and evaluated prognostic values. Tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection specimens of primary breast cancers and their matched distant metastases were immunohistochemically stained for PD-1 and PD-L1. PD-1 was available in both primary tumor and metastasis in 82 patients, and PD-L1 in 49 patients. PD-1 was discrepant between primary tumor and metastasis in half of the patients (50%), PD-L1 on tumor cells was discrepant in 28.5%, and PD-L1 on immune cells in 40.8% of the patients. In primary tumors there was a correlation between PD-1 positivity and a higher tumor grade, and between immune PD-L1 and ER negativity. In survival analyses, a significantly better overall survival was observed for patients with PD-L1 negative primary breast tumors that developed PD-L1 positive distant metastases (HR 3.013, CI 1.201-7.561, p\u2009=\u20090.019). To conclude, PD-1 and tumor and immune PD-L1 seem to be discordantly expressed between primary tumors and their matched distant metastases in about one-third to a half of the breast cancer patients. Further, gained expression of PD-L1 in metastases seems to indicate better survival.

{"context":"Identification and clearance of apoptotic cells prevents the release of harmful cell contents thereby suppressing inflammation and autoimmune reactions. Highly conserved annexins may modulate the phagocytic cell removal by acting as bridging molecules to phosphatidylserine, a characteristic phagocytosis signal of dying cells. In this study five members of the structurally and functionally related annexin family were characterized for their capacity to interact with phosphatidylserine and dying cells. The results showed that AnxA3, AnxA4, AnxA13, and the already described interaction partner AnxA5 can bind to phosphatidylserine and apoptotic cells, whereas AnxA8 lacks this ability. Sequence alignment experiments located the essential amino residues for the recognition of surface exposed phosphatidylserine within the calcium binding motifs common to all annexins. These amino acid residues were missing in the evolutionary young AnxA8 and when they were reintroduced by site directed mutagenesis AnxA8 gains the capability to interact with phosphatidylserine containing liposomes and apoptotic cells. By defining the evolutionary conserved amino acid residues mediating phosphatidylserine binding of annexins we show that the recognition of dying cells represent a common feature of most annexins.

{"context":"Intellectual disability (ID) is estimated to affect 1-3% of the general population and is a common reason for referrals to pediatric and adult geneticists, as well as neurologists. There are many genetic and non-genetic causes of ID; X-linked forms are identifiable through their characteristic inheritance pattern. Current testing methods have been able to identify over 100 genes on the X chromosome responsible for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes. MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels. MED12 is located at Xq13.1 and its product has roles in transcriptional activation and repression. We describe two affected male siblings and their unaffected mother with a novel missense mutation in MED12, c.4147G>A (p.Ala1383Thr). The siblings share some features of Ohdo syndrome, including feeding difficulties, microcephaly, and speech delay. However, additional attributes such as hypertonia, eosinophilic esophagitis, penile chordee, and particular facial dysmorphisms depart sufficiently from individuals previously described such that they appear to represent a new and expanded phenotype. This case lends credence to the evolving theory that the subtypes of Ohdo, and perhaps other MED12 disorders, reflect a spectrum of characteristics, rather than distinct syndromes. As XLID panel testing and whole exome sequencing (WES) becomes a standard of care for affected males, further MED12 mutations will broaden the phenotype of these intriguing disorders and challenge clinicians to rethink the current diagnostic boundaries.","question":"What is the genetic basis of Ohdo syndrome?","answer":"MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels."}
{"context":"Clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins is central to cell survival. Here, we describe a new pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis mediated by the proteasome shuttle factor UBQLN2. The 26S proteasome degrades polyubiquitylated substrates by recognizing them through stoichiometrically bound ubiquitin receptors, but substrates are also delivered by reversibly bound shuttles. We aimed to determine why these parallel delivery mechanisms exist and found that UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act. Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice.","question":"Which human disease is associated with mutated UBQLN2","answer":"Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice."}
{"context":"G-quadruplex (G4) is a higher-order nucleic acid structure that is formed by guanine-rich sequences. G4 stabilization by small-molecule compounds called G4 ligands often causes cytotoxicity, although the potential medicinal impact of this effect has not been fully established. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic G4 ligand, Y2H2-6M(4)-oxazole telomestatin derivative (6OTD), limits the growth of intractable glioblastoma (grade IV glioma) and glioma stem cells (GSCs). Experiments involving a human cancer cell line panel and mouse xenografts revealed that 6OTD exhibits antitumor activity against glioblastoma. 6OTD inhibited the growth of GSCs more potently than it did the growth of differentiated non-stem glioma cells (NSGCs). 6OTD caused DNA damage, G1 cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in GSCs but not in NSGCs. These DNA damage foci tended to colocalize with telomeres, which contain repetitive G4-forming sequences. Compared with temozolomide, a clinical DNA-alkylating agent against glioma, 6OTD required lower concentrations to exert anti-cancer effects and preferentially affected GSCs and telomeres. 6OTD suppressed the intracranial growth of GSC-derived tumors in a mouse xenograft model. These observations indicate that 6OTD targets GSCs through G4 stabilization and promotion of DNA damage responses. Therefore, G4s are promising therapeutic targets for glioblastoma.","question":"Are G-quadruplexes(G4) possible drug targets for glioblastoma?","answer":"These observations indicate that 6OTD targets GSCs through G4 stabilization and promotion of DNA damage responses.

{"context":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune-disease of unknown origin that primarily affects the joints and ultimately leads to their destruction. The involvement of immune cells is a general hallmark of autoimmune-related disorders. In this regard, macrophages, T cells and their respective cytokines play a pivotal role in RA. However, the notion that RA is a primarily T-cell-dependent disease has been strongly challenged during recent years. Rather, it has been understood that resident, fibroblast-like cells contribute significantly to the perpetuation of disease, and that they may even play a role in its initiation. These rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) constitute a quite unique cell type that distinguishes RA from other inflammatory conditions of the joints. A number of studies have demonstrated that RASFs show alterations in morphology and behaviour, including molecular changes in signalling cascades, apoptosis responses and in the expression of adhesion molecules as well as matrix-degrading enzymes. These changes appear to reflect a stable activation of RASFs, which occurs independently of continuous exogenous stimulation. As a consequence, RASFs are no longer considered passive bystanders but active players in the complex intercellular network of RA.","question":"Which cell types are known to be driving Rheumatoid Arthritis?","answer":"it has been understood that resident, fibroblast-like cells contribute significantly to the perpetuation of disease, and that they may even play a role in its initiation"}

{"context":"Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. However, its contribution to the restoration of transcription and to global repair of oxidative damage has not been examined. Here, we report the first direct study of transcriptional recovery following UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage in E. coli. We observed that mutations in mfd or uvrA reduced the rate that transcription recovered following UV-induced damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage. mfd mutants were also fully resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and removed oxidative lesions from the genome at rates comparable to wild-type cells. The results demonstrate that Mfd promotes the rapid recovery of gene expression following UV-induced damage in E. coli. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage.","question":"Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?","answer":"In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage."}

Recent studies using Tpl2 knockout mice have indicated an important role for Tpl2 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and other proinflammatory cytokines involved in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Initial 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads showed poor selectivity for Tpl2 over epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase. Using molecular modeling and crystallographic data of the EGFR kinase domain with and without an EGFR kinase-specific 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor (erlotinib, Tarceva), we hypothesized that we could diminish the inhibition of EGFR kinase by substitution at the C-8 position of our 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads. The 8-substituted-4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitriles were prepared from the appropriate 2-substituted 4-nitroanilines.

This suggests that FA genes may play a role in the development of AML in the wider context. To examine this proposition, further, we have screened samples from 79 AML patients for mutations in the major FA gene, FANCA. No truncating FANCA mutations were detected. One missense mutation previously designated as pathogenic and five novel missense mutations causing non-conservative amino acid substitutions were detected.

An additive effect was observed when 1000 nM retinoic acid was added to either 50 or 500 nM dexamethasone. Treatment with either of these factors resulted in increased glucokinase mRNA levels. In contrast, treatment with thyroid hormone (T3; 0.2 and 10 nM) had no effect on glucokinase activity, but decreased glucokinase mRNA levels. T3 did not affect the response of either activity or mRNA levels to retinoic acid. Binding experiments revealed the presence of a single class of T3 nuclear receptors, with a Kd of 0.46 x 10(-10) and a binding capacity of 3.84 pmol\/mg protein in these cells. This suggests that the changes produced by T3 may be due to a physiological effect mediated via nuclear receptors.

Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart.

{"context":"Seven members of an Ashkenazi Jewish family with Gaucher disease in 3 successive generations were tested for the presence of the 2 common mutations known to occur in the glucocerebrosidase gene. Genomic DNA from blood or skin fibroblasts of relatives was amplified by using the PCR technique and individual mutations identified by oligonucleotides specific to the mutated sequences. Four individuals were homozygous for a mutation at amino acid 370 (370 mutation) known to occur only in type 1 disease. The other 3 affected relatives were compound heterozygotes for this mutation and for a mutation at amino acid 444 (NciI mutation) which, in the homozygous state, is associated with neurological disease. Clinical severity was more marked in the compound heterozygotes than in the homozygotes. Since the mutation is present in Ashkenazim, molecular diagnosis in families which carry the NciI mutation should prove useful in assessing their risk of the neurologic forms of Gaucher disease.","question":"What is the gene mutated in the Gaucher disease?","answer":"Gaucher disease in 3 successive generations were tested for the presence of the 2 common mutations known to occur in the glucocerebrosidase gene"}
{"context":"Although their amino acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 proteins were recently shown by Goll and colleagues to function as RNA methyltransferases transferring a methyl group to the C5 position of C38 in tRNA(Asp). We observe that human DNMT2 methylates tRNA isolated from Dnmt2 knock-out Drosophila melanogaster and Dictyostelium discoideum. RNA extracted from wild type D. melanogaster was methylated to a lower degree, but in the case of Dictyostelium, there was no difference in the methylation of RNA isolated from wild-type and Dnmt2 knock-out strains. Methylation of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Asp) confirms it to be a target of DNMT2. Using site directed mutagenesis, we show here that the enzyme has a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism, because similar residues from motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis as identified in DNA methyltransferases. In addition, exchange of C292, which is located in a CFT motif conserved among Dnmt2 proteins, strongly reduced the catalytic activity of DNMT2.

{"context":"Many cancers overexpress ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of ATF4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored. Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Strikingly, primary embryo fibroblasts from ATF4-deficient mice were resistant to transformation by coexpression of H-ras(V12) and SV40 large T antigen. In wild-type cells these oncogenes induced expression of the murine Atf4 gene along with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a, which encodes the cell senescence-associated proteins p16INK4 and p19ARF. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation. Conversely, genetic ablation of ATF4 led to constitutive expression of p16INK4a and p19ARF, triggering cellular senescence. Our findings define a central function for ATF4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.","question":"Has ATF4 transcription factor been linked to cancer and neoplastic transformation?","answer":"Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation."}

{"context":"Methylation at the 5' position of cytosine in DNA has important roles in genome function and is dynamically reprogrammed during early embryonic and germ cell development. The mammalian genome also contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which seems to be generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by the TET family of enzymes that are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we use antibodies against 5hmC and 5mC together with high throughput sequencing to determine genome-wide patterns of methylation and hydroxymethylation in mouse wild-type and mutant ES cells and differentiating embryoid bodies. We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels. Most, if not all, 5hmC in the genome depends on pre-existing 5mC and the balance between these two modifications is different between genomic regions. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related genes (including Esrrb, Prdm14, Dppa3, Klf2, Tcl1 and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for extraembryonic lineage differentiation. Declining levels of TETs during differentiation are associated with decreased hydroxymethylation levels at the promoters of ES cell-specific genes together with increased methylation and gene silencing. We propose that the balance between hydroxymethylation and methylation in the genome is inextricably linked with the balance between pluripotency and lineage commitment.","question":"What is the role of 5hmC (5 hydroxy-methyl-Cytocine) in differentiation?","answer":"We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels"}

Human amniotic fluid was obtained from patients undergoing amniocentesis. Full-thickness skin obtained during abdominoplasty was divided into 1-cm(2) samples. These specimens were preserved in either saline, HAF from a single patient, pooled HAF, University of Wisconsin solution, or custodial histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution at 4\u00b0C. There were 5 samples in each group. Specimens were examined for keratinocyte survival at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days using the trypan blue assay.

In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily administration of irbesartan 150 or 300 mg, with or without adjunctive antihypertensive agents, provides effective 24-hour BP control. Irbesartan reduced BP to a similar extent to enalapril and atenolol and to a significantly greater extent than losartan.

The drug is effective in the elderly and dosage adjustment is not required in these patients or in those with renal or hepatic failure. Preliminary studies evaluating the efficacy of irbesartan in patients with heart failure have produced encouraging results. Irbesartan is very well tolerated and neither the frequency nor the pattern of adverse events differed from those seen in placebo recipients, although headache was significantly more frequent with the latter. Similarly, the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between irbesartan and enalapril in patients who received either drug as monotherapy. Headache, upper-respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal pain were the most common complaints.

Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method.

This syndrome is caused by entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist (Preston and Shapiro, 2005) when the pressure increases in the carpal tunnel. A high division of the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel, also known as a bifid median nerve, is a rare anatomic variation that may be associated with CTS and with persistent median vessels (Lanz, 1977). This anatomic variation has an incidence of 0,8% to 2,3% in patients with CTS. Lanz (1977) has characterized this anatomic condition of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. These anatomic variants have been classified into four groups: - Group 0: extraligamentous thenar branch (standard anatomy); - Group 1: variations of the course of the thenar branch; - Group 2: accessory branches at the distal portion of the carpal tunnel; - Group 3: divided or duplicated median nerve inside the carpal tunnel; - Group 4: accessory branches proximal to the carpal tunnel. During dissection of the wrist performed for the treatment of a CTS under local anesthesia, we found an anatomical variation of the median nerve that was divided in two branches inside the carpal tunnel (Group 3 of Lanz Classification) and in which its radial branch passed through its own compartment. The two parts of the nerve seems to be unequal in size (Fig. 1). Moreover the nerve passed in carpal tunnel associated with a median artery, so we classified this variation in the group 3b of Lanz Classification (Fig. 2).

Before surgical intervention clinical evaluation of patient and electrophysiological examination showed no differences compared to a non bifid median nerve entrapment syndrome.

However, the anti-cancer effects and the mechanism of actions are still unknown in breast cancer. In this study, we first observed that costunolide inhibits cell growth in a dose-and time-dependent manner. To examine the mechanism by which costunolide inhibits cell growth, we checked the effect of costunolide on apoptosis and the cell cycle. Costunolide induced apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway, including the activation of Fas, caspase-8, caspase-3, and degradation of PARP. However, did not have the same effect on the intrinsic pathway as revealed by analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) with JC-1 dye and expression of Bcl2 and Bax proteins level. Furthermore, costunolide induced cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase via decrease in Cdc2, cyclin B1 and increase in p21WAF1 expression, independent of p53 pathway in p53-mutant MDA-MB-231 cells and increases Cdc2-p21WAF1 binding. In addition, costunolide had a slight induced effect on ROS generation. Among the mechanisms of p21WAF1 induction examined, costunolide-induced increase in p21WAF1 expression was related with protein stability and ROS generation. Through this study we confirm that costunolide induces G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death via extrinsic pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells suggesting that it could be a promising anticancer drug especially for ER-negative breast cancer.","question":"What is the effect of ROS on cyclin B1?","answer":"Furthermore, costunolide induced cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase via decrease in Cdc2, cyclin B1 and increase in p21WAF1 expression,"}

Genome-wide methylation studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins are providing insight into the extent of epigenetic variation that occurs, irrespective of genotype. However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450\u2009K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways.","question":"Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?","answer":"DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments."}

{"context":"The \"tolerable daily intake\" of bisphenol A, established by the European and US regulatory agencies, is based on a small number of reproductive toxicity studies in animals, mostly funded by industry, using protocols that adhere to regulatory guidelines. Many scientists consider these regulatory toxicology tests unsuitable for the evaluation of endocrine disrupters, because they cannot be used to demonstrate the effects of low doses of bisphenol A, observed in dozens of independent studies. Results obtained in studies of high doses of bisphenol A have been extrapolated to predict the effects of low-dose exposure, according to the principle that \"the dose makes the poison\". The validity of this extrapolation is disputed. Some human studies suggest that bisphenol A causes coronary heart disease, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and has harmful effects on reproduction and development. Considerable data from rodent studies suggest that low doses of bisphenol A affect reproduction, lipid metabolism and neurological development, usually following intrauterine or postnatal exposure. In France, the use of bisphenol A in infant feeding bottles has been banned since 30 June 2010, and in food packaging intended for children aged 0 to 3 years since 1 January 2013. The ban is due to be extended to all food packaging as of 1 January 2015. Bisphenol A is not the only substance present in food packaging that could interfere with endocrine function. Too little is known yet about the toxicology of bisphenol A substitutes. Several studies have shown that exposure to bisphenol A in adults and children can be greatly reduced by choosing a varied diet based on fresh foods, and by avoiding the use of plastic tableware. To reduce exposure to bisphenol A and other chemicals with hormonal activity that are present in food packaging, it seems reasonable to encourage the consumption of fresh foods, avoiding canned food and plastic packaging for storing and reheating food and beverages. These precautionary measures are most important for food and beverages intended for pregnant women and young children.","question":"what is the effect of Bisphenol A in the body?","answer":"Considerable data from rodent studies suggest that low doses of bisphenol A affect reproduction, lipid metabolism and neurological development, usually following intrauterine or postnatal exposure."}

{"context":"Operon-like arrangements of genes occur in eukaryotes ranging from yeasts and filamentous fungi to nematodes, plants, and mammals. In plants, several examples of operon-like gene clusters involved in metabolic pathways have recently been characterized, e.g. the cyclic hydroxamic acid pathways in maize, the avenacin biosynthesis gene clusters in oat, the thalianol pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the diterpenoid momilactone cluster in rice. Such operon-like gene clusters are defined by their co-regulation or neighboring positions within immediate vicinity of chromosomal regions. A comprehensive analysis of the expression of neighboring genes therefore accounts a crucial step to reveal the complete set of operon-like gene clusters within a genome. Genome-wide prediction of operon-like gene clusters should contribute to functional annotation efforts and provide novel insight into evolutionary aspects acquiring certain biological functions as well. We predicted co-expressed gene clusters by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient of neighboring genes and randomly selected gene pairs, based on a statistical method that takes false discovery rate (FDR) into consideration for 1469 microarray gene expression datasets of A. thaliana. We estimated that A. thaliana contains 100 operon-like gene clusters in total. We predicted 34 statistically significant gene clusters consisting of 3 to 22 genes each, based on a stringent FDR threshold of 0.1. Functional relationships among genes in individual clusters were estimated by sequence similarity and functional annotation of genes.

The patient had 3 intracranial lesions, 1 of which showed rapid growth within 6\u00a0months; another of the tumors also enlarged within a short period. All of the tumors were surgically treated, and immunohistochemistry indicated a high MIB-1 labeling index in each of the multiple lesions.

Besides, the antitumor activity displayed no difference between radiation concurrently with AZD3759 and radiation sequentially with AZD3759. Mechanistically, we found that two factors determined the enhanced efficacy: cells with EGFRm which were sensitive to AZD3759, and a relative high concentration of AZD3759.

It demonstrates potent antitumour activity at much lower doses than parent compounds with high therapeutic efficacy in paediatric blood cancers.

Comparisons of the accuracy of the revisited El Escorial and Awaji criteria support improved diagnostic sensitivity without any effect on specificity with the new classification. The only weakness of the new classification involves patients with UMN signs in one region and LMN in two regions; these patients were previously classified as laboratory-supported probable ALS and currently as possible ALS, a lower level of diagnostic certainty.

This interaction, which could be recapitulated using recombinant proteins in pull-down experiments, involves the catalytic domain of EIF2AK2 as well as the SH2 domain of STAT3, which can adopt a fold similar to that of EIF2S1. Thus, STAT3 may act as a competitive inhibitor of EIF2AK2. Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type STAT3 as well as of STAT3 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by JAK2 or are excluded from the nucleus inhibits autophagy. However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy. Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula, yet only the latter does so in cell-free systems in vitro. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8\/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8\/JNK1) and EIF2S1. These results reveal an unsuspected crosstalk between cellular metabolism (fatty acids), pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3), innate immunity (EIF2AK2), and translational control (EIF2S1) that regulates autophagy.","question":"Is STAT3 involved in EIF2AK2-dependent suppression of autophagy?","answer":"A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8\/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8\/JNK1) and EIF2S1.

{"context":"Epigenetic alterations, including methylation, have been shown to be an important mechanism of gene silencing in cancer. Ependymoma has been well characterized at the DNA copy number and mRNA expression levels. However little is known about DNA methylation changes. To gain a more global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma we conducted an array-based analysis. Our data demonstrated tumors to segregate according to their location in the CNS, which was associated with a difference in the global level of methylation. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. This hypermethylated profile was associated with an increase in expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in methylating DNA, suggesting an underlying mechanism. An integrated analysis of methylation and mRNA expression array data allowed us to identify methylation-induced expression changes. Most notably genes involved in the control of cell growth and death and the immune system were identified, including members of the JNK pathway and PPARG. In conclusion, we have generated a global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis.","question":"Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?","answer":"The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas.

{"context":"It has recently been recognized that thyroid hormones may rapidly generate biological responses by non-genomic mechanisms that are unaffected by inhibitors of transcription and translation. The signal transduction pathways underlying these effects are just beginning to be defined. We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1. The phosphorylation of Akt was T3 specific and dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85alpha subunit and the thyroid receptor beta1 were able to form a complex at the cytoplasmic level in both the cell lines, suggesting that a 'cytoplasmic TRbeta1' was implicated. Moreover, we evidenced that T3 treatment was able to induce kinase activity of the TRbeta1-associated PI3K. The silencing of TRbeta1 expression through RNAi confirmed this receptor to be crucial for the T3-induced activation of Akt. This action involved a T3-induced nuclear translocation of activated Akt, as demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence. In summary, T3 is able to specifically activate Akt in the islet beta cells rRINm5F and hCM through the interaction between TRbeta1 and PI3K p85alpha, demonstrating the involvement of TRbeta1 in this novel T3 non-genomic action in islet beta cells.","question":"Does  thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion?","answer":"We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1."}
{"context":"Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early genes. It regulates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation and is involved in tumor growth. In our experiments, the role of Cyr61 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was examined. Expression of Cyr61 mRNA was decreased markedly in four of five human lung tumor samples compared with their normal matched lung samples. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H520 and H460, which have no endogenous Cyr61, formed 60-90% fewer colonies after being transfected with a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector than cells transfected with the same amount of empty vector. After stable transfection of a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector, proliferation of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 sublines decreased remarkably compared with the cells stably transfected with empty vector. The addition of antibody against Cyr61 partially rescued the growth suppression of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells developed G(1) arrest, prominently up-regulated expression of p53 and p21(WAF1), and had decreased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The increase of pocket protein pRB2\/p130 was also detected in these cells. Notably, both of the Cyr61-stably transfected lung cancer cell lines developed smaller tumors than those formed by the wild-type cells in nude mice.

{"context":"Ras proteins are small GTPase functioning as molecular switches that, in response to particular extracellular signalling, as growth factors, activate a diverse array of intracellular effector cascades regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Human tumours frequently express Ras proteins (Ha-, Ki-, N-Ras) activated by point mutations which contribute to malignant phenotype, including invasiveness and angiogenesis. Despite the common signalling pathways leading to similar cellular responses, studies clearly demonstrate unique roles of the Ras family members in normal and pathological conditions and the lack of functional redundancy seems to be explainable, at least in part, by the ability of Ras isoforms to localize in different microdomains to plasma membrane and intracellular organelles. This different intracellular compartmentalization could help Ras isoforms to contact different downstream effectors finally leading to different biological outcomes. Interestingly, it has also been shown that Ha- and Ki-Ras exert an opposite role in regulating intracellular redox status. In this regard we suggest that H-Ras specific induction of ROS (reactive oxygen species) production could be one of the main determinants of the invasive phenotype which characterize cancer cells harbouring H-Ras mutations. In our hypothesis then, while K-Ras (not able to promote oxidative stress) could mainly contribute to cancer progression and invasiveness through activation of MAPK and PI3K, H-Ras-mediated oxidative stress could play a unique role in modulation of intercellular contacts leading to a loss of cell adhesion and eventually also to a metastatic spread.","question":"Which are the different members\/isoforms of the Ras oncogenes?","answer":"Ras proteins are small GTPase functioning as molecular switches that, in response to particular extracellular signalling, as growth factors, activate a diverse array of intracellular effector cascades regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

{"context":"We have previously demonstrated proteasomal degradation of DNMT1 in mammalian cells following treatment with several DNA hypomethylating agents. Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent degradation of Dnmt1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing catalytic site mutant (cys-ser), confirming that the covalent bond formation between Dnmt1 and decitabine-incorporated DNA is not essential for this process. DNMT1o, the oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the N-terminal 118-amino acid domain, did not undergo decitabine-mediated degradation, which further proves the requirement of multiple domains including nuclear localization signal, KEN box, and BAH domains for this process. Analysis of glycerol density gradient fractions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei showed that both nucleosomal and nucleoplasmic DNMT1 are degraded upon decitabine treatment. Among different inhibitors tested, the inhibitors of the proteasomal pathway and several protein kinases impeded decitabine-induced DNMT1 degradation. The maximal effect caused by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) persuaded us to investigate further its role in decitabine-mediated DNMT1 degradation. Blockage of the degradation process after treatment with rottlerin, an inhibitor of PKC\u03b4, or after siRNA-mediated depletion of PKC\u03b4, indicated that this protein kinase is involved in decitabine-mediated depletion of DNMT1. PKC\u03b4 interacted with and phosphorylated DNMT1 in vitro. Moreover, rottlerin inhibited both basal and decitabine-induced phosphorylation of DNMT1.

{"context":"The centromeric regions of all Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes are found in early replicating domains, a property conserved among centromeres in fungi and some higher eukaryotes. Surprisingly, little is known about the biological significance or the mechanism of early centromere replication; however, the extensive conservation suggests that it is important for chromosome maintenance. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? In Candida albicans, a neocentromere contains an early firing origin, supporting the first hypothesis but not addressing whether the new origin is intrinsically early firing or whether the centromere influences replication time. Because the activation time of individual origins is not an intrinsic property of S. cerevisiae origins, but is influenced by surrounding sequences, we sought to test the hypothesis that centromeres influence replication time by moving a centromere to a late replication domain. We used a modified Meselson-Stahl density transfer assay to measure the kinetics of replication for regions of chromosome XIV in which either the functional centromere or a point-mutated version had been moved near origins that reside in a late replication region. We show that a functional centromere acts in cis over a distance as great as 19 kb to advance the initiation time of origins. Our results constitute a direct link between establishment of the kinetochore and the replication initiation machinery, and suggest that the proposed higher-order structure of the pericentric chromatin influences replication initiation.","question":"Do origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire early or late?","answer":"Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions?"}
{"context":"Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers PLN exhibits ion channel activity with a low unitary conductance. From the effect of non-electrolyte polymers on this unitary conductance we estimate a narrow pore with a diameter of ca. 2.2 \u00c5 for this channel. This value is similar to that reported for the central pore in the structure of the PLN pentamer. Hence the PLN pentamer, which is in equilibrium with the monomer, is the most likely channel forming structure. Reconstituted PLN mutants, which either stabilize (K27A and R9C) or destabilize (I47A) the PLN pentamer and also phosphorylated PLN still generate the same unitary conductance of the wt\/non-phosphorylated PLN. However the open probability of the phosphorylated PLN and of the R9C mutant is significantly lower than that of the respective wt\/non-phosphorylated control. In the context of data on PLN\/SERCA interaction and on Ca(2+) accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum the present results are consistent with the view that PLN channel activity could participate in the balancing of charge during Ca(2+) uptake. A reduced total conductance of the K(+) transporting PLN by phosphorylation or by the R9C mutation may stimulate Ca(2+) uptake in the same way as an inhibition of K(+) channels in the SR membrane. The R9C-PLN mutation, a putative cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, might hence affect SERCA activity also via its inherent low open probability.","question":"How does phospholamban affect the biological activity of the calcium ATPase SERCA?","answer":"Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum."}

Cerebellar atrophy was constant and the earliest feature of the disease preceding brain iron accumulation, leading to the provisional diagnosis of a recessive progressive ataxia in these patients.

Furthermore, we note similarities between the structure of all three pseudogene loci and the Alu family of middle repetitive DNA sequences. These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III.","question":"Are Alu elements transcribed?","answer":"These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III."}
{"context":"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) plays important roles in multifaceted cellular processes. Study has shown that inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5\/6 kinase (5\/6 kinase) interacts with CSN in mammalian cells. However, the biological function of the interaction still remains unknown. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5\/6 kinase (AtItpk-1) is also associated with CSN and involved in photomorphogenesis under red light (RL) conditions, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of AtItpk-1 with CSN and characterization of the atitpk-1 mutants. Expression analysis showed that AtItpk-1 had the same sub-cellular localization and organ expression pattern as CSN. Furthermore, autophosphorylation analysis showed that AtItpk-1 has protein kinase activity. Under RL, the atitpk-1 mutants exhibited phenotype slightly similar with that of the csn mutants, indicating that 5\/6 kinase might be involved in the same developmental pathway as CSN.

Most of transcribed RNAs are lncRNAs and repetitive elements. In this review, we will detail the discovery of a new functional class of natural and synthetic antisense lncRNAs that stimulate translation of sense mRNAs. These molecules have been named SINEUPs since their function requires the activity of an embedded inverted SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation. Natural SINEUPs suggest that embedded Transposable Elements may represent functional domains in long non-coding RNAs. Synthetic SINEUPs may be designed by targeting the antisense sequence to the mRNA of choice representing the first scalable tool to increase protein synthesis of potentially any gene of interest.

{"context":"The SILVER locus has been mapped in the domestic cat, identifying a unique genomic location distinct from that of any known reported gene associated with silver or hypopigmentation in mammals. A demonstrated lack of linkage to SILV, the strong candidate gene for silver, led to the initiation of a genome scan utilizing 2 pedigrees segregating for silver coat color. Linkage mapping defined a genomic region for SILVER as a 3.3-Mb region, (95.87-99.21 Mb) on chromosome D2, (peak logarithm of the odds = 10.5, = 0), which displays conserved synteny to a genomic interval between 118.58 and 121.85 Mb on chromosome 10 in the human genome. In the domestic cat, mutations at the SILVER locus suppress the development of pigment in the hair, but in contrast to other mammalian silver variants, there is an apparently greater influence on the production of pheomelanin than eumelanin pigment.

{"context":"The hepatic hormone hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron metabolism. Its expression is largely regulated by 2 signaling pathways: the \"iron-regulated\" bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and the inflammatory JAK-STAT pathways. To obtain broader insights into cellular processes that modulate hepcidin transcription and to provide a resource to identify novel genetic modifiers of systemic iron homeostasis, we designed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen that monitors hepcidin promoter activity after the knockdown of 19\u2009599 genes in hepatocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, many of the putative hepcidin activators play roles in signal transduction, inflammation, or transcription, and affect hepcidin transcription through BMP-responsive elements. Furthermore, our work sheds light on new components of the transcriptional machinery that maintain steady-state levels of hepcidin expression and its responses to the BMP- and interleukin-6-triggered signals. Notably, we discover hepcidin suppression mediated via components of Ras\/RAF MAPK and mTOR signaling, linking hepcidin transcriptional control to the pathways that respond to mitogen stimulation and nutrient status.

However, identifying Alu exons that have acquired genuine biological functions remains a major challenge. We investigated the creation and establishment of Alu exons in human genes, using transcriptome profiles of human tissues generated by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with extensive RT-PCR analysis. More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. Genes encoding zinc finger transcription factors have significantly higher levels of Alu exonization. Importantly, Alu exons with high splicing activities are strongly enriched in the 5'-UTR, and two-thirds (10\/15) of 5'-UTR Alu exons tested by luciferase reporter assays significantly alter mRNA translational efficiency. Mutational analysis reveals the specific molecular mechanisms by which newly created 5'-UTR Alu exons modulate translational efficiency, such as the creation or elongation of upstream ORFs that repress the translation of the primary ORFs. This study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation.

{"context":"A single cell has the potential to kill an entire human being. Efforts to cure cancer are limited by survival of individual cancer cells despite immune surveillance and toxic therapies. Understanding the intricate network of pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and mediate stress response or default into cell death is critical to the development of strategies to eradicate cancer. Autophagy, proteasomal degradation and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are cellular pathways that degrade and recycle excess or damaged proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis and survival. This review will discuss autophagy and how it is integrated with proteasomal degradation and UPR to govern cell fate through restoration of cellular homeostasis or default into the apoptotic cell death pathway. The first response of autophagy is macroautophagy, which sequesters cytoplasm including organelles inside double-membraned autophagosome vesicles that fuse with lysosomes to degrade and recycle the contents. Ubiquitination patterns on proteins targeted for degradation determine whether adapter proteins will bring them to developing autophagosomes or to proteasomes. Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor. These two processes and the lesser understood microautophagy, which involves direct engulfment of proteins into lysosomes, occur at basal and induced levels. Insufficient proteasome function or ER stress induction of UPR can induce autophagy, which can mitigate damage and stress. If this network is incapable of repairing the damage or overcoming continued stress, the default pathway of apoptosis is engaged to destroy the cell. Induction of macroautophagy by cancer therapeutics has led to clinical trials investigating combinations of HCQ (hydroxychloriquine) suppression of autophagy with apoptosis-inducing agents. Further study of the complex integration of autophagy, proteasomal degradation, UPR and apoptosis is likely to provide additional targets for our fight against cancer.

Here we report identification of a noncanonical form of SECIS element in Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora canine, single-celled apicomplexan parasites of humans and domestic animals. This SECIS has a GGGA sequence in the SBP2-binding site in place of AUGA previously considered invariant. Using a combination of computational and molecular techniques, we show that Toxoplasma and Neospora possess both canonical and noncanonical SECIS elements.

Epidermal changes included acanthosis and confluent parakeratosis with neutrophils and frank pustules. Dermal changes included markedly increased catagen\/telogen and miniaturized hairs and peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation. Numerous plasma cells and eosinophils were present in all cases. Biopsies from the nonscalp lesions showed psoriasiform changes and prominent eosinophils and plasma cells. Two patients showed significant improvement of the alopecia with topical treatment only. In conclusion, anti-TNF therapy-related alopecia may closely mimic psoriatic alopecia and alopecia areata but can be histologically distinguished from alopecia areata by epidermal psoriasiform changes and dermal plasma cells and from primary psoriasis by the presence of plasma cells and eosinophils. A correct diagnosis can enable effective treatment and, in some cases, allow anti-TNF therapy to continue.","question":"Which are the most widely reported side-effects in the treatment of Crohn's disease?","answer":"3 patients who developed scalp alopecia"}

{"context":"Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. Our understanding of the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant 1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na\/Ca exchanger function were not altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve.","question":"Which is the main regulatory molecule of SERCA2A function in the cardiac muscle?","answer":"phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a"}
{"context":"The osteogenic and oncogenic transcription factor RUNX2 downregulates the RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I)-mediated transcription of rRNAs and changes histone modifications associated with the rDNA repeat. However, the mechanisms by which RUNX2 suppresses rRNA transcription are not well understood. RUNX2 cofactors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription. Here, we show that RUNX2 recruits HDAC1 to the rDNA repeats in osseous cells. This recruitment alters the histone modifications associated with active rRNA-encoding genes and causes deacetylation of the protein upstream binding factor (UBF, also known as UBTF). Downregulation of RUNX2 expression reduces the localization of HDAC1 to the nucleolar periphery and also decreases the association between HDAC1 and UBF. Functionally, depletion of HDAC1 relieves the RUNX2-mediated repression of rRNA-encoding genes and concomitantly increases cell proliferation and global protein synthesis in osseous cells. Our findings collectively identify a RUNX2-HDAC1-dependent mechanism for the regulation of rRNA-encoding genes and suggest that there is plasticity to RUNX2-mediated epigenetic control, which is mediated through selective mitotic exclusion of co-regulatory factors.","question":"How histone deacetylation causes transcriptional gene silencing?","answer":"RUNX2 cofactors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription."}

{"context":"Elmo1 and Elmo2 are highly homologous cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that interact with Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors to promote activation of the small GTPase Rac. In T lymphocytes, Dock2 is essential for CCR7- and CXCR4-dependent Rac activation and chemotaxis, but the role of Elmo proteins in regulating Dock2 function in primary T cells is not known. In this article, we show that endogenous Elmo1, but not Elmo2, interacts constitutively with Dock2 in mouse and human primary T cells. CD4(+) T cells from Elmo1(-\/-) mice were profoundly impaired in polarization, Rac activation, and chemotaxis in response to CCR7 and CXCR4 stimulation. Transfection of full-length Elmo1, but not Elmo2 or a Dock2-binding mutant of Elmo1, rescued defective migration of Elmo1(-\/-) T cells. Interestingly, Dock2 protein levels were reduced by 4-fold in Elmo1(-\/-) lymphocytes despite normal levels of Dock2 mRNA. Dock2 polyubiquitination was increased in Elmo1(-\/-) T cells, and treatment with proteasome inhibitors partially restored Dock2 levels in Elmo1(-\/-) T cells. Finally, we show that Dock2 is directly ubiquitinated in CD4(+) T cells and that Elmo1 expression in heterologous cells inhibits ubiquitination of Dock2. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes. Inhibition of Dock2 has therapeutic potential as a means to control recruitment of pathogenic lymphocytes in diseased tissues.

{"context":"The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid costly TF ChIP-seq assays. Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin\/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to the standard presence\/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq data sets.

{"context":"To investigate the importance of core promoter elements for tissue-specific transcription of RNA polymerase II genes, we examined testis-specific transcription in Drosophila melanogaster. Bioinformatic analyses of core promoter sequences from 190 genes that are specifically expressed in testes identified a 10 bp A\/T-rich motif that is identical to the translational control element (TCE). The TCE functions in the 5' untranslated region of Mst(3)CGP mRNAs to repress translation, and it also functions in a heterologous gene to regulate transcription. We found that among genes with focused initiation patterns, the TCE is significantly enriched in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in testes but not in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in other tissues. The TCE is variably located in core promoters and is conserved in melanogaster subgroup species, but conservation dramatically drops in more distant species. In transgenic flies, short (300-400 bp) genomic regions containing a TCE directed testis-specific transcription of a reporter gene. Mutation of the TCE significantly reduced but did not abolish reporter gene transcription indicating that the TCE is important but not essential for transcription activation. Finally, mutation of testis-specific TFIID (tTFIID) subunits significantly reduced the transcription of a subset of endogenous TCE-containing but not TCE-lacking genes, suggesting that tTFIID activity is limited to TCE-containing genes but that tTFIID is not an obligatory regulator of TCE-containing genes. Thus, the TCE is a core promoter element in a subset of genes that are specifically expressed in testes. Furthermore, the TCE regulates transcription in the context of short genomic regions, from variable locations in the core promoter, and both dependently and independently of tTFIID. These findings set the stage for determining the mechanism by which the TCE regulates testis-specific transcription and understanding the dual role of the TCE in translational and transcriptional regulation.","question":"Is the Drosophila Translational Control Element (TCE) involved in spermatogenesis?","answer":"Bioinformatic analyses of core promoter sequences from 190 genes that are specifically expressed in testes identified a 10 bp A\/T-rich motif that is identical to the translational control element (TCE)"}

{"context":"Sclerosteosis is a progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia. Sclerostin (the SOST gene) was originally identified as the sclerosteosis-causing gene. However, the physiological role of sclerostin remains to be elucidated. Sclerostin was intensely expressed in developing bones of mouse embryos. Punctuated expression of sclerostin was localized on the surfaces of both intramembranously forming skull bones and endochondrally forming long bones. Sclerostin-positive cells were identified as osteoclasts. Recombinant sclerostin protein produced in cultured cells was efficiently secreted as a monomer. We examined effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sclerostin inhibited the BMP6 and BMP7 activity but not the BMP2 and BMP4 activity. Sclerostin bound to BMP6 and BMP7 with high affinity but bound to BMP2 and BMP4 with lower affinity. In conclusion, sclerostin is a novel secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and\/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs.

Differentiation promoted by T(3) (1 nM), RA (1 microM), or combined T(3)\/RA was assessed in wild-type (wt) and mutant (m) ES cells on the basis of neuronal-specific gene expression and cell cycle.

The proband presented with facial dysmorphism, arthrogryposis, and intrauterine growth retardation. Most cases of Miller-Dieker syndrome have a de novo deletion involving 17p13.3. When Miller-Dieker syndrome is caused by an unbalanced translocation, mild-to-severe phenotypes occur according to the extension of the involved partner chromosome.

Results of clinical studies on zanubrutinib treatment appear promising in patients with several types of B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. There are not yet enough clinical data to determine which BTK inhibitor is most effective in treating B-cell malignancies without causing harmful side effects. Early data from the phase 3 ALPINE clinical study suggest that zanubrutinib works better than ibrutinib, and fewer patients experience side effects and quit treatment. Zanubrutinib is currently approved for use for treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with WM, and for adults with MZL who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy.","question":"What clinical applications is Zanubrutinib approved for in the United States?","answer":"Zanubrutinib is currently approved for use for treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, for adults with WM, and for adults with MZL who have received at least one anti-CD20-based therapy."}

None of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. Because it is impossible to predict the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation status based on clinical examination alone, all patients with unicoronal synostosis should be tested for it.

{"context":"An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expanding CAG triplet repeats that code for polyglutamine. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis.","question":"List diseases caused by protein glutamine expanded repeats","answer":"An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expanding CAG triplet repeats that code for polyglutamine.

Transcription factor Sp1 (specificity protein 1) can regulate the expression of several AD-related proteins, including amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor and tau. Sp1 is regulated by oxidative stress, and Sp1 mRNA was found to be upregulated in AD cortex and hippocampus. The distribution of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs7300593, rs17695156, and rs12821290, covering 100% Sp1 genetic variability, has been determined in a population of 393 AD patients as compared with 412 controls. In addition, expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis. No differences in all three SNP distributions were observed in AD patients as compared with controls. Stratifying according to gender, a significantly decreased frequency of Sp1 rs17695156 T allele was observed in male patients versus male controls. Significantly increased Sp1 relative expression levels were observed in PBMCs from AD patients as compared with controls. Western blot analysis paralleled mRNA increase in AD patients versus controls and correlated positively with Sp1 mRNA levels. Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patients versus controls and correlated negatively with Sp1 mRNA levels. According to these results, Sp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.

{"context":"While the prognosis of acute childhood leukemia has improved, long-term survivors are increasingly experiencing late effects of the treatment. Cranially irradiated survivors are predisposed to the development of CNS tumors. Our aim was to describe the incidence of secondary brain tumors and to define the significance of treatment-related risk factors and host characteristics in a cohort of childhood leukemia survivors. Our cohort consisted of 60 consecutive cranially irradiated adult survivors of childhood leukemia treated in Oulu University Hospital (Oulu, Finland); MRI of the brain was performed on 49. The sites of the tumors, their histology, and details of the leukemia treatment were determined. Of the 49 patients, 11 (22%) 1-8 years of age at the time of diagnosis developed meningioma later in life, while no other brain tumors were seen. In this cohort, the development of meningioma seemed to show undisputable linkage with long latency periods (mean, 25 years; range, 14-34 years) and an increasing incidence 20 years after the treatment (47%). Three patients had multiple meningiomas, two had recurrent disease, and one had an atypical meningioma. Age at the time of irradiation, gender, or cumulative doses of chemotherapeutic agents showed no significant association with the development of meningiomas. The high incidence of meningiomas in this study was associated with long follow-up periods. Although the cohort is small, it seems probable that the increasing incidence of meningioma will shadow the future of cranially irradiated leukemia survivors. Systematic brain imaging after the treatment is therefore justifiable.","question":"Is there an increased risk for meningiomas in childhood leukemia survivors?","answer":"Age at the time of irradiation, gender, or cumulative doses of chemotherapeutic agents showed no significant association with the development of meningiomas."}
{"context":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a prominent genetic disease of infant mortality, is caused by low levels of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein owing to deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene. SMN2, a nearly identical copy of SMN1 present in humans, cannot compensate for the loss of SMN1 because of predominant skipping of exon 7 during pre-mRNA splicing. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of nusinersen (Spinraza), the potential for correction of SMN2 exon 7 splicing as an SMA therapy has been affirmed. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) discovered in 2004 at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. ISS-N1 has emerged as the model target for testing the therapeutic efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides using different chemistries as well as different mouse models of SMA. Here, we provide a historical account of events that led to the discovery of ISS-N1 and describe the impact of independent validations that raised the profile of ISS-N1 as one of the most potent antisense targets for the treatment of a genetic disease. Recent approval of nusinersen provides a much-needed boost for antisense technology that is just beginning to realize its potential.

The SWR1 complex catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of the nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ (Htz1p). The activity of NuA4 is responsible mainly for the acetylation of the H4 histone but also for the acetylation of H2A and H2AZ. In this work we investigated the role of the Swc4p protein. Using random mutagenesis we isolated a collection of swc4 mutants and showed that the essential function of Swc4p resides in its N-terminal part, within the first 269 amino acids of the 476-amino acid-long protein. We also demonstrated that Swc4p is able to accommodate numerous mutations without losing its functionality under standard growth conditions. However, when swc4 mutants were exposed to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), hydroxyurea or benomyl, severe growth deficiencies appeared, pointing to an involvement of Swc4p in many chromatin-based processes. The mutants' phenotypes did not result from an impairment of histone acetylation, as in the mutant which bears the shortest isolated variant of truncated Swc4p, the level of overall H4 acetylation was unchanged.","question":"Which protein mediates the replacement of H2A by H2A.Z in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae?","answer":"The Swc4p protein, encoded by an essential gene, is shared by two chromatin-remodeling complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells: NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) and SWR1.

{"context":"Epigenetic phenomena, and in particular heritable epigenetic changes, or transgenerational effects, are the subject of much discussion in the current literature. This article presents a model of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and explores the effect of epigenetic inheritance on the risk and recurrence risk of a complex disease. The model assumes that epigenetic modifications of the genome are gained and lost at specified rates and that each modification contributes multiplicatively to disease risk. The potentially high rate of loss of epigenetic modifications causes the probability of identity in state in close relatives to be smaller than is implied by their relatedness. As a consequence, the recurrence risk to close relatives is reduced. Although epigenetic modifications may contribute substantially to average risk, they will not contribute much to recurrence risk and heritability unless they persist on average for many generations. If they do persist for long times, they are equivalent to mutations and hence are likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs surveyed in genomewide association studies. Thus epigenetic modifications are a potential solution to the problem of missing causality of complex diseases but not to the problem of missing heritability. The model highlights the need for empirical estimates of the persistence times of heritable epialleles.","question":"Are epigenetic changes heritable?","answer":"Although epigenetic modifications may contribute substantially to average risk, they will not contribute much to recurrence risk and heritability unless they persist on average for many generations."}

{"context":"Axon regeneration in the mature central nervous system is limited by extrinsic inhibitory signals and a postnatal decline in neurons' intrinsic growth capacity. Neuronal levels of the second messenger cAMP are important in regulating both intrinsic growth capacity and neurons' responses to extrinsic factors. Approaches which increase intracellular cAMP in neurons enhance neurite outgrowth and facilitate regeneration after injury. Thus, understanding the factors which affect cAMP in neurons is of potential therapeutic importance. Recently, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC, ADCY10), the ubiquitous, non-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase, was found to play a key role in neuronal survival and axon growth. sAC is activated by bicarbonate and cations and may translate physiologic signals from metabolism and electrical activity into a neuron's decision to survive or regenerate. Here we critically review the literature surrounding sAC and cAMP signaling in neurons to further elucidate the potential role of sAC signaling in neurite outgrowth and regeneration.

{"context":"Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system. Impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) function culminates in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in many neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms underlying cell death induced by an impaired UPS are still not clear. Intriguingly, recent studies indicate that several proteins associated with familial PD are capable of promoting the assembly of Lys-63 polyubiquitin chains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the role of K48 and K63 ubiquitination in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in in vitro models of dopaminergic degeneration. Exposure of the widely used proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to dopaminergic neuronal cell line (N27) induced a rapid accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the mitochondria. This appears to result in the preferential association of ubiquitin conjugates in the outer membrane and polyubiquitination of outer membrane proteins. Interestingly, the ubiquitin(K48R) mutant effectively rescued cells from MG-132-induced mitochondrial apoptosis without altering the antioxidant status of cells; whereas the ubiquitin(K63R) mutant augmented the proapoptotic effect of MG-132. Herein, we report a novel conclusion that polyubiquitinated proteins, otherwise subjected to proteasomal degradation, preferentially accumulate in the mitochondria during proteolytic stress; and that polyubiquitination of Lys-48 and Lys-63 are key determinants of mitochondria-mediated cell death during proteasomal dysfunction. Together, these findings yield novel insights into a crosstalk between the UPS and mitochondria in dopaminergic neuronal cells.","question":"What is the biological role of K-48 linked protein ubiquitination?","answer":"Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system."}
{"context":"Psammoma bodies (PBs) are concentric lamellated calcified structures, observed most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), meningioma, and papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary but have rarely been reported in other neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions. PBs are said to represent a process of dystrophic calcification. Despite numerous ancillary studies over a span of three and half decades, formation of PBs remains a poorly understood mechanism. Ultrastructural study of PTC has shown that thickening of the base lamina in vascular stalk of neoplastic papillae followed by thrombosis, calcification, and tumor cell necrosis leads to formation of PBs. Studies on serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and meningioma, however, revealed that collagen production by neoplastic cells and subsequent calcification was responsible for the formation of PBs. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. Cellular degeneration and necrosis, leading to the disappearance of neoplastic cells, were noticed by us only around PBs but not around the precursor forms. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that rather than being the outcome of dystrophic calcification of dead or dying tissue, PBs may indeed represent an active biologic process ultimately leading to degeneration\/death of tumor cells and retardation of growth of the neoplasm. It may also serve as a barrier against the spread of neoplasm.","question":"Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?","answer":"The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells."}

This review discusses recent studies addressing the question of whether there is extensive FSHD-related transcription dysregulation in adult-derived myoblasts and myotubes, the precursors for muscle repair. Two models for the role of DUX4 in FSHD are presented. One involves transient pathogenic expression of DUX4 in many cells in the muscle lineage before the myoblast stage resulting in a persistent, disease-related transcription profile ('Majority Rules'), which might be enhanced by subsequent oscillatory expression of DUX4. The other model emphasizes the toxic effects of inappropriate expression of DUX4 in only an extremely small percentage of FSHD myoblasts or myotube nuclei ('Minority Rules'). The currently favored Minority Rules model is not supported by recent studies of transcription dysregulation in FSHD myoblasts and myotubes. It also presents other difficulties, for example, explaining the expression of full-length DUX4 transcripts in FSHD fibroblasts.

Recently, activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channels in the pancreatic beta-cells were found to be an important cause of PNDM. The mutated KATP channels do not close in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) so the beta-cell membrane is hyperpolarized and insulin secretion does not occur.

In addition, we found a significant decrease in the % tail DNA in thinner-treated cells after liquid-holding recovery period (all p\u2009<\u20090.05), demonstrating that DNA primary lesions induced by low-cytotoxic thinner concentrations are efficiently repaired. In conclusion, thinner components induce cytotoxicity and genomic damage in human lymphocytes under the study conditions, possibly by oxidative and alkylative DNA damage.","question":"What is Trypan blue used for?","answer":" cell-viability analysis with trypan blue "}
{"context":"Arsenic is a clinically effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) in which the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is fused to retinoic receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1). PML-RAR\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4. Thus the variable C-terminal domain influences the rate and location of degradation of PML isoforms following arsenic treatment.","question":"How many PML isoforms exist in the human genome?","answer":"Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region."}

URA3 reporter assays also indicated that H3K79 methylation is required for HM silencing. Surprisingly, a genome-wide expression analysis of H3K79 methylation-defective mutants identified only a few telomeric genes, such as COS12 at TEL-VII-L, to be subject to H3K79 methylation-dependent natural silencing. Consistently, loss of Dot1 did not globally alter Sir2 or Sir3 occupancy in subtelomeric regions, but only led to some telomere-specific changes. Furthermore, H3K79 methylation by Dot1 did not play a role in the maintenance of natural HML silencing.

{"context":"Cardiac-type sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2)-ATPase (SERCA2a) plays a major role in cardiac muscle contractility. Phospholamban (PLN) regulates the function of SERCA2a via its Ser(16)-phosphorylation. Since it has been proposed that the Ser\/Thr residues on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), we examined the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on PLN function in rat adult cardiomyocytes. Studies using enzymatic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation of wild type and a series of mutants of PLN showed that PLN was O-GlcNAcylated and Ser(16) of PLN might be the site for O-GlcNAcylation. In cardiomyocytes treated with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), the O-GlcNAcylation was significantly increased compared to non-treated cells. Simultaneously, Ser(16)-phosphorylation of PLN was reduced. In Chinese hamster ovary cells where PLN cDNA and O-GlcNAc transferase siRNA were co-transfected, the Ser(16)-phosphorylation of PLN was significantly increased compared to controls. The same results were observed in heart homogenates from diabetic rats. In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes. Unlike non-treated cells, the activity of SERCA2a and the profiles of calcium transients in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes were not significantly changed even after treatment with catecholamine. These data suggest that PLN is O-GlcNAcylated to induce the inhibition of its phosphorylation, which correlates to the deterioration of cardiac function. This might define a novel mechanism by which PLN regulation of SERCA2a is altered under conditions where O-GlcNAcylation is increased, such as those occurring in diabetes.","question":"Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?","answer":"In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes."}

Microbial dysbiosis as well as exposure to toxins including xenoestrogens are thought to be risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease development and relapse. Bisphenol-A has been shown to exert estrogenic activity in the colon and alter intestinal function, but the role that xenoestrogens, such as bisphenol-A , play in colonic inflammation has been previously described but with conflicting results. We investigated the ability of bisphenol-A to exacerbate colonic inflammation and alter microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in an acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis model. Female C57BL\/6 mice were ovariectomized and exposed to bisphenol-A daily for 15 days. Disease activity measures include body weight, fecal consistency, and rectal bleeding. Colons were scored for inflammation, injury, and nodularity. Alterations in the levels of microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids known to reflect phenotypic changes in the gut microbiome were analyzed. Bisphenol-A exposure increased mortality and worsened disease activity as well as inflammation and nodularity scores in the middle colon region following dextran sulfate sodium exposure. Unique patterns of metabolites were associated with bisphenol-A consumption. Regardless of dextran sulfate sodium treatment, bisphenol-A reduced levels of tryptophan and several metabolites associated with decreased inflammation in the colon. This is the first study to show that bisphenol-A treatment alone can reduce microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in the colon which may be associated with increased colonic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease.

Twelve animals were given dabigatran etexilate (DE) orally and dabigatran intravenously, before infliction of trauma. Six animals received tranexamic acid plus fibrinogen concentrate 12 minutes post-injury. Six PCCs (each 30 and 60 U\/kg) and idarucizumab (30 and 60 mg\/kg) were added to blood samples ex vivo. Coagulation was assessed by several coagulation assays. All coagulation parameters were altered after dabigatran infusion (plasma level: 442 \u00b1 138 ng\/ml). Both three- and four-factor PCCs mostly or completely reversed the effects of dabigatran on thromboelastometry variables and PT but not on aPTT. Idarucizumab neutralised plasma concentrations of dabigatran, and reversed the effects of the drug on coagulation variables. Thrombin generation showed dose-dependent over-correction following the addition of PCC, implying that elevated levels of thrombin are required to overcome dabigatran-induced coagulopathy. In contrast, treatment with idarucizumab returned thrombin generation to baseline levels. Following trauma, therapy with tranexamic acid plus fibrinogen improved correction of coagulation parameters by PCC, and thromboelastometry parameters by idarucizumab. All investigated PCCs improved dabigatran- and trauma-induced coagulopathy to a similar degree.

{"context":"Protein extensibility appears to be based broadly on conformational changes that can in principle be modulated by protein-protein interactions. Spectrin family proteins, with their extensible three-helix folds, enable evaluation of dimerization effects at the single molecule level by atomic force microscopy. Although some spectrin family members function physiologically only as homodimers (e.g. alpha-actinin) or are strictly monomers (e.g. dystrophin), alpha- and beta-spectrins are stable as monomeric forms but occur physiologically as alpha,beta-heterodimers bound laterally lengthwise. For short constructs of alpha- and beta-spectrin, either as monomers or as alpha,beta-dimers, sawtooth patterns in atomic force microscopy-forced extension show that unfolding stochastically extends repeats approximately 4-5-fold greater in length than native conformations. For both dimers and monomers, distributions of unfolding lengths appear bimodal; major unfolding peaks reflect single repeats, and minor unfolding peaks at twice the length reflect tandem repeats. Cooperative unfolding thus propagates through helical linkers between serial repeats (1, 2). With lateral heterodimers, however, the force distribution is broad and shifted to higher forces. The associated chains in a dimer can stay together and unfold simultaneously in addition to unfolding independently. Weak lateral interactions do not inhibit unfolding, but strong lateral interactions facilitate simultaneous unfolding analogous to serial repeat coupling within spectrin family proteins.","question":"Alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin subunits form parallel or antiparallel heterodimers?","answer":"alpha- and beta-spectrins are stable as monomeric forms but occur physiologically as alpha,beta-heterodimers"}

{"context":"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations of the parkin gene. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically recognizes its substrate protein, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that AR-JP may be caused by accumulation of an unidentified neurotoxic protein, which is a substrate of parkin. Based on this hypothesis, we cloned parkin-binding protein using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a putative G protein-coupled receptor protein,which we named the Pael receptor (Pael-R). When overexpressed in cells, this receptor became unfolded, insoluble, and ubiquitinated. Accumulation of the insoluble Pael-R subsequently led to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. Parkin specifically ubiquitinates the unfolded Pael-R and promotes its degradation, resulting in suppression of cell death induced by the accumulation of unfolded Pael-R. Moreover, insoluble Pael-R accumulates in the brains of AR-JP patients. It is highly expressed by the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, strongly suggesting that accumulation of unfolded Pael-R may lead to selective death of dopaminergic neurons in AR-JP.Recently, we identified Hsp70 and its co-chaperone CHIP as novel parkin-binding partners. We found that CHIP enhanced parkinmediated ubiquitination of Pael-R.

{"context":"Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway that appears to be part of the network including breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2. In response to DNA damage or replication signals, a nuclear FA core complex of at least 6 FA proteins (FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCL) is activated and leads to monoubiquitination of the downstream FA protein, FANCD2. One puzzling question for this pathway is the role of BRCA2. A previous study has proposed that BRCA2 could be identical to two FA proteins: FANCD1, which functions either downstream or in a parallel pathway; and FANCB, which functions upstream of the FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Now, a new study shows that the real FANCB protein is not BRCA2, but a previously uncharacterized component of the FA core complex, FAAP95, suggesting that BRCA2 does not act upstream of the FA pathway.

Bone marrow derived stem cells, skeletal myoblasts and resident adult cardiac stem cells are being explored as potential cell types for heart failure treatment. These cells can be delivered to the heart via a number of routes. Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident. A more comprehensive understanding of regenerative physiology at the \"benchside\" combined with ongoing investigations at the bedside, will be paramount in achieving the ultimate goal of stem cell treatment-complete regeneration and repair of tissue.","question":"Are there clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of cardiac disease?","answer":"Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident."}
{"context":"Obesity is highly associated with insulin resistance and is the biggest risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The molecular basis of this common syndrome, however, is poorly understood. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha. The absence of TNF-alpha resulted in significantly improved insulin sensitivity in both diet-induced obesity and that resulting for the ob\/ob model of obesity. The TNFalpha-deficient obese mice had lower levels of circulating free fatty acids, and were protected from the obesity-related reduction in the insulin receptor signalling in muscle and fat tissues. These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action.","question":"What is the role of TNF in obesity?","answer":"To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha."}

{"context":"Histatins are a group of small, cationic, antifungal peptides present in human saliva. A previous molecular modeling analysis suggested structural similarity between the Phe14-His15 and His18-His19 dipeptide sequences in histatin-5 (Hsn-5; a 24-amino-acid polypeptide) and the sequence of miconazole (one of the azole-based antifungal therapeutic agents), implying that the mechanisms of killing of Candida albicans by these two molecules may be similar. To further elaborate on this observation, we have produced two variants of Hsn-5 in which Phe14-His15 or His18-His19 dipeptide sequences were replaced by Ala-Ala (F14A\/H15A and H18A\/H19A) to eliminate the phenyl and imidazole rings of the side chains and assessed their candidacidal activities against C. albicans. In addition, we tested azole-resistant C. albicans and Candida glabrata strains for their susceptibilities to Hsn-5. Analysis of the purified recombinant proteins for their candidacidal activities indicated that both variants were significantly less effective (the molar concentrations required to kill half of the maximum number of cells [ED50s], approximately 67 and approximately 149 microM for F14A\/H15A and H18A\/H19A, respectively) than the unaltered Hsn-5 (ED50, approximately 8 microM) at killing C. albicans, suggesting that the two dipeptide sequences are important for the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5. Assessment of the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5 with the well-characterized azole-resistant strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata, however, suggested that the mode of action of histatins against Candida is distinct from that of azole-based antifungal agents because Hsn-5 kills both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains equally well.","question":"How does Hst5 (histatin 5) affect infections by Candida glabrata?","answer":"Assessment of the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5 with the well-characterized azole-resistant strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata, however, suggested that the mode of action of histatins against Candida is distinct from that of azole-based antifungal agents because Hsn-5 kills both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains equally well."}

However, ORC has been little explored in protists, and only a single ORC protein, related to both Orc1 and Cdc6, has been shown to act in DNA replication in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we identify three highly diverged putative T. brucei ORC components that interact with ORC1\/CDC6 and contribute to cell division. Two of these factors are so diverged that we cannot determine if they are eukaryotic ORC subunit orthologues, or are parasite-specific replication factors. The other we show to be a highly diverged Orc4 orthologue, demonstrating that this is one of the most widely conserved ORC subunits in protists and revealing it to be a key element of eukaryotic ORC architecture. Additionally, we have examined interactions amongst the T. brucei MCM subunits and show that this has the conventional eukaryotic heterohexameric structure, suggesting that divergence in the T. brucei replication machinery is limited to the earliest steps in origin licensing.","question":"Which are the components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in eukaryotes?","answer":"In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1.

The music was a Mozart sonata (a pleasant and energetic piece) for some participants and an Albinoni adagio (a slow, sad piece) for others. We also measured enjoyment, arousal, and mood. Performance on tbe spatial task was better following the music than the silence condition but only for participants who heard Mozart.

For those who reached the cut-off for ASD, well standardized diagnostic instruments (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, WISC-III, and Kinder-DIPS) should be administered. Minimal diagnostic criteria for Moebius sequence were congenital facial weakness (uni- or bilateral) and impairment of ocular abduction (uni- or bilateral). Familiar cases should be excluded.

{"context":"Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently associating kinase module. Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression. Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing. Individual Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. In addition to its role in genomic signaling, MED12 has been implicated in non-genomic signaling by interacting with and activating TGF-beta receptor 2 in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have revealed extensive inter-domain interactions and complex architecture of the Mediator-Pol II complex, suggesting that Mediator is capable of reorganizing its conformation and composition to fit cellular needs. We propose that alterations in Mediator subunit expression that occur in various cancers could impact the organization and function of Mediator, resulting in changes in gene expression that promote malignancy. A better understanding of the role of Mediator in cancer could reveal new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of Mediator-dependent endocrine cancers, especially in settings of therapy resistance.","question":"Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?","answer":"Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression."}

{"context":"Forward motility stimulating factor (FMSF), a glycoprotein isolated from buffalo serum, binds to the surface of the mature sperm cells to promote their progressive motility. This article reports the mode of signal transduction of this extracellular factor in goat sperm. The mechanism was investigated by assaying intracellular second messenger level and forward motility in presence of different pharmacological modulators. Mg++-dependent Forskolin responsive form of transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) of goat spermatozoa was probed for its involvement in FMSF action. Dideoxyadenosine, a selective inhibitor of tmACs, was used to identify the role of this enzyme in the scheme of FMSF-signaling. Involvement of the \u03b1-subunit of G-protein in this regard has been inspected using GTP\u03b3S. Participation of protein kinase A (PKA) and tyrosine kinase was checked using IP20 and genistein, respectively. FMSF promotes tmAC activity in a dose-dependent manner through receptor\/G-protein activation to enhance intracellular cAMP and forward motility. Motility boosting effects of this glycoprotein are almost lost in presence of dideoxyadenosine. But, FMSF displayed substantial motility promoting activity when movement of spermatozoa was inhibited with KH7, the specific inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase indicating tmAC to be the primary target of FMSF action. Involvement of cAMP in mediating FMSF action was confirmed by the application of dibutyryl cAMP. Observed motility regulatory effects with IP20 and genistein indicate contribution of PKA and tyrosine kinase in FMSF activity; enhanced phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing \u224850 kDa protein was detected in this regard. FMSF initiates a novel signaling cascade to stimulate tmAC activity that augments intracellular cAMP, which through downstream crosstalk of phosphokinases leads to enhanced forward motility in mature spermatozoa.

To address this issue, we evaluated the involvement of an oxytocin homolog (isotocin, referred herein as oxt) in mate choice in medaka fish (). Female medaka prefer to choose familiar mates, whereas male medaka court indiscriminately, irrespective of familiarity. We generated mutants of the oxt ligand () and receptor genes ( and ) and revealed that the oxt-oxtr1 signaling pathway was essential for eliciting female mate preference for familiar males. This pathway was also required for unrestricted and indiscriminate mating strategy in males. That is, either  or  mutation in males decreased the number of courtship displays toward novel females, but not toward familiar females. Further, males with these mutations exhibited enhanced mate-guarding behaviors toward familiar females, but not toward novel females.

{"context":"We have used frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the structural linkage between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the regulatory protein phospholamban (PLB). Using an engineered PLB having a single cysteine (Cys(24)) derivatized with the fluorophore N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PMal), we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the average spatial separation and conformational heterogeneity between PMal bound to Cys(24) in the transmembrane domain and Tyr(6) in the cytosolic domain near the amino terminus of PLB. In these measurements, PMal serves as a FRET donor, and Tyr(6) serves as a FRET acceptor following its nitration by tetranitromethane. The native structure of PLB is retained following site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification, as indicated by the ability of the derivatized PLB to fully regulate the Ca-ATPase following their co-reconstitution. To assess how phosphorylation modulates the structure of PLB itself, FRET measurements were made following reconstitution of PLB in membrane vesicles made from extracted sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane lipids. We find that the cytosolic domain of PLB assumes a wide range of conformations relative to the transmembrane sequence, consistent with other structural data indicating the presence of a flexible hinge region between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of PLB. Phosphorylation of Ser(16) by PKA results in a 3 A decrease in the spatial separation between PMal at Cys(24) and nitroTyr(6) and an almost 2-fold decrease in conformational heterogeneity, suggesting a stabilization of the hinge region of PLB possibly through an electrostatic linkage between phosphoSer(16) and Arg(13) that promotes a coil-to-helix transition. This structural transition has the potential to function as a conformational switch, since inhibition of the Ca-ATPase requires disruption of the secondary structure of PLB in the vicinity of the hinge element to permit association with the nucleotide binding domain at a site located approximately 50 A above the membrane surface. Following phosphorylation, the stabilization of the helical content in the hinge domain will disrupt this inhibitory interaction by reducing the maximal dimension of the cytosolic domain of PLB. Thus, stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16) is part of a switching mechanism, which functions to alter binding interactions between PLB and the nucleotide binding domain of the Ca-ATPase that modulates enzyme inhibition.","question":"Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?","answer":"stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16)"}

Furthermore, we demonstrated that LY294002 down-regulated HuR expression in a time-dependent manner in BEL-7404. In summary, we have, for the first time, demonstrate that PI3K\/Akt pathway regulates the expression of DNMT3B at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which is particularly important to understand the effects of PI3K\/Akt and DNMT3B on hepatocarcinogenesis.","question":"Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?","answer":"DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are essential for maintenance of aberrant methylation in cancer cells and play important roles in the development of cancers."}

{"context":"Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) possess direct oncolytic and antiangiogenic activities and are promising anticancer agents, but their efficacy, when used as single agents, leaves room for improvement. We investigated whether combination therapy of HSV with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), an agent that also targets cancer cells and tumor vasculature, would result in enhanced efficacy. In vitro, TSA and G47Delta showed strong synergy of action against proliferating endothelial cells, varying degrees of synergistic action against most cancer cell lines, but no effect in quiescent, normal endothelial and prostate epithelial cells. Synergy is dependent on viral replication; however, it is not dependent on the dosing sequence of TSA and G47Delta, viral genetic alterations, infectivity, or replication kinetics of G47Delta. Using an isogenic cell system, we found that a high level of cellular cyclin D1 is also critically important for the interaction. Normal cells with low cyclin D1 levels were not subjected to toxicity by either agent. In tumor cells and proliferating endothelial cells, the combination treatment enhanced the inhibition of cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Concurrent systemic TSA and intratumoral G47Delta administration resulted in enhanced antiangiogenesis and enhanced antitumoral efficacy in animal models.

Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1\/Kcnq1ot1 loci. Similar to the H19\/Igf2 locus, CTCF and cohesins preferentially bind to the Gtl2 differentially methylated region (DMR) on the unmethylated maternal allele. To determine the functional importance of the binding of CTCF and cohesins at the three imprinted loci, CTCF and cohesins were depleted in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The monoallelic expression of imprinted genes at these three loci was maintained. However, mRNA levels for these genes were typically increased; for H19 and Igf2 the increased level of expression was independent of the CTCF-binding sites in the imprinting control region.

ESCRT-III is the final complex in the pathway that assembles on endosomes and executes membrane scission of intraluminal vesicles. In addition, proteins of this complex are involved in other topologically similar processes such as cytokinesis, virus egress and autophagy. Here we show that protein kinase CK2\u03b1 is involved in the phosphorylation of the ESCRT-III subunits CHMP3 and CHMP2B, as well as of VPS4B\/SKD1, an ATPase that mediates ESCRT-III disassembly. This phosphorylation is observed both in vitro and in cells. While we do not observe recruitment of CK2\u03b1 to endosomes, we demonstrate the localization of CK2\u03b1 to midbodies during cytokinesis. Phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutants of ESCRT-III proteins can still bind endosomes and localize to midbodies, indicating that CK2\u03b1 does not regulate ESCRT-III localization. Finally, we analyzed two cellular functions where CHMP3, CHMP2B and VPS4 are known to be involved, epidermal growth factor degradation and cytokinetic abscission.

However, segregation for the presence or absence of grain saponin in F2 generations derived from crosses between high- and low-saponin parents indicates a major gene effect, with plants homozygous for a recessive allele spl having no detectable grain saponin. Variation in saponin levels among F2 plants with detectable grain saponin was consistent with polygenic inheritance.

Here, we report that Alfy, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective elimination of aggregated proteins. We report that the loss of Alfy inhibits the clearance of inclusions, with little to no effect on the starvation response. Alfy is recruited to intracellular inclusions and scaffolds a complex between p62(SQSTM1)-positive proteins and the autophagic effectors Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L, and LC3. Alfy overexpression leads to elimination of aggregates in an Atg5-dependent manner and, likewise, to protection in a neuronal and Drosophila model of polyglutamine toxicity.

{"context":"Propionic acidemia results from mutations in either of the two genes, PCCA or PCCB, that encode the two subunits of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme. In this study, we report the identification and analysis of seven novel splicing mutations involving consensus donor and acceptor splice sites. Most of them were identified in patients with a Central Asian origin, and some present in several alleles, probably reflecting founder effects. The functional consequences of the splicing mutations were analyzed in patients' fibroblasts, as well as transcript quantification using real-time PCR methods. In the PCCA gene, two mutations were demonstrated to affect 5' splice sites (c.231+1G>C and c.1209+3A>G) and two 3' acceptor splice sites (c.1210delG and c.1430G>T), all causing skipping of the exons involved, with no detectable levels of normally spliced transcript. In the PCCB gene, all three mutations involved 5' donor splice sites-two affected exon 1 splicing (c.154_183+17del46 and c.183+2T>C), the latter activating a cryptic splice site in intron 1, and the remaining mutation (c.1498+2T>C) resulted in exon 14 skipping.

The miR-1 expression levels were significantly increased in cardiac myocytes from VMC mice in comparison with control samples (relative expression: 10 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 31 \u00b1 7.6, P < 0.05). Among the target genes of miR-1, the expression Cx43 protein was significantly reduced in such mice while there was no significant difference in the its mRNA levels.

Using a bioinformatics-based approach, we found two identical potential binding sites were found in mouse miR-1 and Cx43 3'- untranslated region, this confirms a possible regulatory role of miR-1. In cultured, miRNA transfected myocardial cells, we show overexpression of miR-1 accompanied by a decrease in Cx43 protein's expression.

Here, we carried out a broad survey of AHL production in nitrifying bacteria in three steps.

Exposure to 50 ng\/ml HGF significantly induced COX-2 protein expression and PGE2 release, whereas other growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, the insulin-like growth factor I protein, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and TGF-beta1, had no effects on COX-2 expression or PGE2 release. COX-2 induction by HGF was preceded by activation of ERK1\/2, and an ERK1\/2-specific inhibitor, U-0126 (10 microM), completely abolished HGF-induced COX-2 expression. Exposure of MDCK cells to 10 ng\/ml TGF-beta1 for 72 h induced EMT as evidenced by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of E-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin. In contrast, treatment with 1 microM PGE2 completely blocked EMT, associated with a significant elevation of intracellular cAMP and complete blockade of TGF-beta1-induced oxidant production. cAMP-elevating agents, including 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, and IBMX, inhibited EMT and associated oxidative stress induced by TGF-beta1, but inhibition of cAMP pathway with Rp-cAMP, the cAMP analog, and H89, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, did not block the effect of PGE2.

Our analysis shows that aCNEs have been evolving at different rates in different bony vertebrate lineages. Although 78-83% of CNEs have diverged beyond recognition (\"lost\") in different teleost fishes, only 24% and 40% have been lost in the chicken and mammalian lineages, respectively. Relative rate tests of substitution rates in CNEs revealed that the teleost fish CNEs have been evolving at a significantly higher rate than those in other bony vertebrates.

However, in vivo T cell responses upon antigen presentation in the absence of SATB1 remain unclear. In the current study, it was shown that SATB1 modulates T cell antigen responses during the induction and effector phases. Expression of SATB1 was upregulated in response to TCR stimulation, suggesting that SATB1 is important for this antigen response.

Expression of the focal adhesion protein Hic-5 has been shown to be up-regulated in epithelial cells in response to TGF-\u03b2. Herein, we demonstrate that TGF-\u03b2-induced Hic-5 up-regulation or ectopic expression of Hic-5 in normal MCF10A cells promoted increased extracellular matrix degradation and invasion through the formation of invadopodia. Hic-5 was tyrosine phosphorylated in an Src-dependent manner after TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and inhibition of Src activity or overexpression of a Y38\/60F nonphosphorylatable mutant of Hic-5 inhibited matrix degradation and invasion. RhoC, but not RhoA, was also required for TGF-\u03b2- and Hic-5-induced matrix degradation. Hic-5 also induced matrix degradation, cell migration, and invasion in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 via Rac1 regulation of p38 MAPK.

{"context":"Tularemia, caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, is a severe, sometimes fatal disease. Interest in tularemia has increased over the last decade due to its history as a biological weapon. In particular, development of novel vaccines directed at protecting against pneumonic tularemia has been an important goal. Previous work has demonstrated that, when delivered at very high inoculums, administration of live, highly attenuated strains of virulent F. tularensis can protect against tularemia. However, lower vaccinating inoculums did not offer similar immunity. One concern of using live vaccines is that the host may develop mild tularemia in response to infection and use of high inoculums may contribute to this issue. Thus, generation of a live vaccine that can efficiently protect against tularemia when delivered in low numbers, e.g. <100 organisms, may address this concern. Herein we describe the ability of three defined, attenuated mutants of F. tularensis SchuS4, deleted for FTT0369c, FTT1676, or FTT0369c and FTT1676, respectively, to engender protective immunity against tularemia when delivered at concentrations of approximately 50 or fewer bacteria. Attenuated strains for use as vaccines were selected by their inability to efficiently replicate in macrophages in vitro and impaired replication and dissemination in vivo. Although all strains were defective for replication in vitro within macrophages, protective efficacy of each attenuated mutant was correlated with their ability to modestly replicate and disseminate in the host. Finally, we demonstrate the parenteral vaccination with these strains offered superior protection against pneumonic tularemia than intranasal vaccination. Together our data provides proof of principle that low dose attenuated vaccines may be a viable goal in development of novel vaccines directed against tularemia.","question":"What organism causes tularemia?","answer":"Tularemia, caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, is a severe, sometimes fatal disease."}

The aim of our study was to examine the effect of chronic and acute treatment with simvastatin on the contractile function of the isolated perfused rat heart after ischemia\/reperfusion injury. Contractile function was measured on isolated rat hearts, perfused according to Langendorff under constant pressure. The hearts were subjected to 20 min of global ischemia, followed by 40 min of reperfusion. To investigate the acute effect, simvastatin at a concentration of 10 micromol\/l was added to the perfusion solution during reperfusion. In chronic experiments the rats were fed simvastatin at a concentration of 10 mg\/kg for two weeks before the measurement of the contractile function. Acute simvastatin administration significantly increased reparation of the peak of pressure development [(+dP\/dt)(max)] (52.9+\/-8.2 %) after global ischemia, as compared with the control group (28.8+\/-5.2 %). Similar differences were also observed in the time course of the recovery of [(+dP\/dt)(max)]. Chronic simvastatin was without any protective effect.

In March 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The properties of apremilast were evaluated to determine its specificity, effects on intracellular signaling, gene and protein expression, and in vivo pharmacology using models of innate and adaptive immunity. Apremilast inhibited PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2), with IC50 values in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit other PDEs, kinases, enzymes, or receptors. While both apremilast and thalidomide share a phthalimide ring structure, apremilast lacks the glutarimide ring and thus fails to bind to cereblon, the target of thalidomide action. In monocytes and T cells, apremilast elevated intracellular cAMP and induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase A substrates CREB and activating transcription factor-1 while inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of several genes induced via TLR4. Apremilast reduced interferon-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibited T-cell cytokine production, but had little effect on B-cell immunoglobulin secretion. In a transgenic T-cell and B-cell transfer murine model, apremilast (5mg\/kg\/day p.o.) did not affect clonal expansion of either T or B cells and had little or no effect on their expression of activation markers. The effect of apremilast on innate immunity was tested in the ferret lung neutrophilia model, which allows monitoring of the known PDE4 inhibitor gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Apremilast significantly inhibited lung neutrophilia at 1mg\/kg, but did not induce significant emetic reflexes at doses <30 mg\/kg.

{"context":"Sideritis scardica Griseb. (ironwort, mountain tea), an endemic plant of the Balkan Peninsula, has been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of gastrointestinal complaints, inflammation, and rheumatic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate its gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Besides, continuously increasing interest in assessing the role of the plant active constituents preventing the risk of cancer was a reason to make a detailed examination of the investigated ethanol, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and N-butanol extracts regarding cytotoxicity. Oral administration of the investigated extracts caused a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in a model of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Gastroprotective activity of the extracts was investigated using an ethanol-induced acute stress ulcer in rats. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was assessed on PBMC, B16, and HL-60 cells and compared to the cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds identified in extracts. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death were analyzed by double staining with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI. The developed HPLC method enabled qualitative fingerprint analysis of phenolic compounds in the investigated extracts. Compared to the effect of the positive control, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacine (4 mg\/kg), which produced a 50 % decrease in inflammation, diethyl ether and N-butanol extracts exhibited about the same effect in doses of 200 and 100 mg\/kg (53.6 and 48.7 %; 48.4 and 49.9 %, respectively). All investigated extracts produced dose-dependent gastroprotective activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug ranitidine. The diethyl ether extract showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity on B16 cells and HL-60 cells, decreasing cell growth to 51.3 % and 77.5 % of control, respectively, when used at 100 \u00b5g\/mL. It seems that phenolic compounds (apigenin, luteolin, and their corresponding glycosides) are responsible for the diethyl ether extract cytotoxic effect. It also appears that induction of oxidative stress might be involved in its cytotoxicity, since B16 and HL-60 cells increased their ROS production in response to treatment with diethyl ether extract. Neither of the tested extracts nor any phenolic compounds showed significant cytotoxic effect to human PBMC. These results demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activities, as well as the promising cytotoxicity.","question":"What is another name for the plant Sideritis scardica?","answer":"Sideritis scardica Griseb.

Regular cardiac evaluation is mandatory to assess the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Unique atrial pathology is seen at autopsy. The mutated gene in EDMD is localized to the long arm of the X chromosome. Mutations in the gene lead to abolished synthesis of the gene product, emerin.

{"context":"Neural progenitors of the Drosophila larval brain, called neuroblasts, can be divided into distinct populations based on patterns of proliferation and differentiation. Type I neuroblasts produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce differentiated progeny, while type II neuroblasts produce self-renewing intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and thus generate lineages containing many more progeny. We identified Taranis (Tara) as an important determinant of type I lineage-specific neural progenitor proliferation patterns. Tara is an ortholog of mammalian SERTAD proteins that are known to regulate cell cycle progression. Tara is differentially-expressed in neural progenitors, with high levels of expression in proliferating type I neuroblasts but no detectable expression in type II lineage INPs. Tara is necessary for cell cycle reactivation in quiescent neuroblasts and for cell cycle progression in type I lineages. Cell cycle defects in tara mutant neuroblasts are due to decreased activation of the E2F1\/Dp transcription factor complex and delayed progression through S-phase. Mis-expression of tara in type II lineages delays INP cell cycle progression and induces premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs. Premature INP differentiation can also be induced by loss of E2F1\/Dp function and elevated E2F1\/Dp expression suppresses Tara-induced INP differentiation. Our results show that lineage-specific Tara expression is necessary for proper brain development and suggest that distinct cell cycle regulatory mechanisms exist in type I versus type II neural progenitors.","question":"What is the difference between ganglion mother cells (GMC) and intermediate neural precursor cells (INP) in Drosophila?","answer":"Type I neuroblasts produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce differentiated progeny, while type II neuroblasts produce self-renewing intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and thus generate lineages containing many more progeny."}

The bacterial cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is thought to initiate tissue responses leading to PPROM in the setting of Gram negative infection. LPS is recognized by the innate immune system, including the proteins encoded by the CARD15 and TLR4 genes. A recently described mutation (2936insC) in CARD15 and a polymorphism in TLR4 896 A>G impair responses to LPS. The objective of this study was to determine if African Americans, who have a higher incidence of PPROM than Caucasians, have different frequencies of the mutant CARD15 allele and the TLR4 hyporesponsive variant, and if risk of PPROM is influenced by fetal carriage of these alleles. The allele frequencies for the CARD15 mutation and the TLR4 896G variant in African Americans were similar to those reported for Caucasians. There was no association between the TLR4 alleles examined and PPROM. However, the CARD15 mutation was only detected in controls and not in PPROM cases. We conclude that the CARD15 mutation and hyporesponsive TLR4 allele do not contribute to ethnic variation in the incidence of PPROM.","question":"What is PPROM?","answer":"Infection is believed to be a leading cause of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)."}
{"context":"The chromatin structure at the Drosophila hsp26 promoter in vivo is characterized by two DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites harboring regulatory elements. Proximal and distal DH sites are separated by a positioned nucleosome. To study the contribution of transcription factors to the establishment of this specific chromatin configuration we assembled nucleosomes on the hsp26 promoter using a cell-free reconstitution system derived from fly embryos. Both DH sites were readily reconstituted from extract components. They were separated by a nucleosome which was less strictly positioned than its in vivo counterpart. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions. While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.","question":"Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?","answer":"While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization."}

Most meningiomas had simple genomes, with fewer mutations, rearrangements and copy-number alterations than reported in other tumors in adults. However, several meningiomas harbored more complex patterns of copy-number changes and rearrangements, including one tumor with chromothripsis. We confirmed focal NF2 inactivation in 43% of tumors and found alterations in epigenetic modifiers in an additional 8% of tumors. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways.

{"context":"RNA splicing generates multiple transcript isoforms from a single gene and enhances the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.

It remains unknown whether operonic genes generate transcript isoforms in a similar manner as non-operonic genes do, the expression of which is less likely limited by their positions and relationships with surrounding genes. We analyzed the number of transcript isoforms of Caenorhabditis elegans operonic genes and found that C. elegans operons contain a much higher proportion of genes with multiple transcript isoforms than non-operonic genes do. For genes that express multiple transcript isoforms, there is no apparent difference between the number of isoforms in operonic and non-operonic genes. C. elegans operonic genes also have a different preference of the 20 most common 3' splice sites compared to non-operonic genes.

{"context":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The 7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE\/AR1c elements. Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs.

However, the molecular pathway linking SMN defect to the SMA phenotype remains unclear. From a better knowledge of the genetic basis of SMA and the defects resulting from the mutations of SMN1 in cellular or animal models, several therapeutics strategies have been selected aiming at targeting SMN2, a partially functional copy of SMN1 gene which remains present in patients, or to prevent neurons from death. Refined characterization of the degenerative process in SMA and the identification of the defective molecular pathway downstream from the SMN defect will provide further exciting insight into this disease in the near future.

{"context":"Phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (H3S10P) has been linked to a variety of cellular processes, such as chromosome condensation and gene activation\/silencing. Remarkably, in mammalian somatic cells, H3S10P initiates in the pericentromeric heterochromatin during the late G2 phase, and phosphorylation spreads throughout the chromosomes arms in prophase, being maintained until the onset of anaphase when it gets dephosphorylated. Considerable studies have been carried out about H3S10P in different organisms; however, there is little information about this histone modification in mammalian embryos. We hypothesized that this epigenetic modification could also be a marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin in preimplantation embryos. We therefore followed the H3S10P distribution pattern in the G1\/S and G2 phases through the entire preimplantation development in in vivo mouse embryos. We paid special attention to its localization relative to another pericentromeric heterochromatin marker, HP1\u03b2 and performed immunoFISH using specific pericentromeric heterochromatin probes. Our results indicate that H3S10P presents a remarkable distribution pattern in preimplantation mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage and is a better marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin than HP1\u03b2. After the 8-cell stage, H3S10P kinetic is more similar to the somatic one, initiating during G2 in chromocenters and disappearing upon telophase. Based on these findings, we believe that H3S10P is a good marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin, especially in the late 1- and 2-cell stages as it labels both parental genomes and that it can be used to further investigate epigenetic regulation and heterochromatin mechanisms in early preimplantation embryos.","question":"Which histone modifications are associated with constitutive heterochromatin?","answer":"Remarkably, in mammalian somatic cells, H3S10P initiates in the pericentromeric heterochromatin during the late G2 phase, and phosphorylation spreads throughout the chromosomes arms in prophase, being maintained until the onset of anaphase when it gets dephosphorylated"}

Here we report a homology-independent approach for discovering viroids, a distinct class of free circular RNA subviral pathogens that encode no protein and are known to infect plants only. Our approach involves analyzing the sequences of the total small RNAs of the infected plants obtained by deep sequencing with a unique computational algorithm, progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). Viroid infection triggers production of viroid-derived overlapping siRNAs that cover the entire genome with high densities. PFOR retains viroid-specific siRNAs for genome assembly by progressively eliminating nonoverlapping small RNAs and those that overlap but cannot be assembled into a direct repeat RNA, which is synthesized from circular or multimeric repeated-sequence templates during viroid replication. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants. PFOR analysis of a grapevine library further identified a viroid-like circular RNA 375 nt long that shared no significant sequence homology with known molecules and encoded active hammerhead ribozymes in RNAs of both plus and minus polarities, which presumably self-cleave to release monomer from multimeric replicative intermediates.

HHRH is distinct from other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets in that affected individuals present with hypercalciuria due to increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption. We performed a genomewide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping, using genomic DNA from a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred that included 10 patients who received the diagnosis of HHRH. The disease mapped to a 1.6-Mbp region on chromosome 9q34, which contains SLC34A3, the gene encoding the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaP(i)-IIc. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion (c.228delC) in this candidate gene in all individuals affected by HHRH. This mutation is predicted to truncate the NaP(i)-IIc protein in the first membrane-spanning domain and thus likely results in a complete loss of function of this protein in individuals homozygous for c.228delC. In addition, compound heterozygous missense and deletion mutations were found in three additional unrelated HHRH kindreds, which supports the conclusion that this disease is caused by SLC34A3 mutations affecting both alleles. Individuals of the investigated kindreds who were heterozygous for a SLC34A3 mutation frequently showed hypercalciuria, often in association with mild hypophosphatemia and\/or elevations in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.

{"context":"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent the na\u00efve ground state of the preimplantation epiblast and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) represent the primed state of the postimplantation epiblast. Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that Otx2, a transcription factor essential for brain development, plays a crucial role in ESCs and EpiSCs. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, Otx2 is required for ESC transition into EpiSCs and, subsequently, to stabilize the EpiSC state by suppressing, in pluripotent cells, the mesendoderm-to-neural fate switch in cooperation with BMP4 and Fgf2. However, according to its central role in neural development and differentiation, Otx2 is crucially required for the specification of ESC-derived neural precursors fated to generate telencephalic and mesencephalic neurons.

By massively parallel sequencing of a primary hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (36\u00d7 coverage) and matched lymphocytes (>28\u00d7 coverage) from the same individual, we identified more than 11,000 somatic substitutions of the tumor genome that showed predominance of T>C\/A>G transition and a decrease of the T>C substitution on the transcribed strand, suggesting preferential DNA repair. Gene annotation enrichment analysis of 63 validated non-synonymous substitutions revealed enrichment of phosphoproteins. We further validated 22 chromosomal rearrangements, generating four fusion transcripts that had altered transcriptional regulation (BCORL1-ELF4) or promoter activity. Whole-exome sequencing at a higher sequence depth (>76\u00d7 coverage) revealed a TSC1 nonsense substitution in a subpopulation of the tumor cells. This first high-resolution characterization of a virus-associated cancer genome identified previously uncharacterized mutation patterns, intra-chromosomal rearrangements and fusion genes, as well as genetic heterogeneity within the tumor.","question":"What is an acceptable sequence coverage(depth) required for human whole-exome sequencing?","answer":"Whole-exome sequencing at a higher sequence depth (>76\u00d7 coverage) revealed a TSC1 nonsense substitution in a subpopulation of the tumor cells.

{"context":"Neuroprotection aims to prevent salvageable neurons from dying. Despite showing efficacy in experimental stroke studies, the concept of neuroprotection has failed in clinical trials. Reasons for the translational difficulties include a lack of methodological agreement between preclinical and clinical studies and the heterogeneity of stroke in humans compared to homogeneous strokes in animal models. Even when the international recommendations for preclinical stroke research, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, were followed, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, examples being NXY-059 and haematopoietic growth factors which fulfilled nearly all the STAIR criteria. However, there are a number of neuroprotective treatments under investigation in clinical trials such as hypothermia and ebselen. Moreover, promising neuroprotective treatments based on a deeper understanding of the complex pathophysiology of ischemic stroke such as inhibitors of NADPH oxidases and PSD-95 are currently evaluated in preclinical studies. Further concepts to improve translation include the investigation of neuroprotectants in multicenter preclinical Phase III-type studies, improved animal models, and close alignment between clinical trial and preclinical methodologies. Future successful translation will require both new concepts for preclinical testing and innovative approaches based on mechanistic insights into the ischemic cascade.","question":"Can NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?","answer":"Even when the international recommendations for preclinical stroke research, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, were followed, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, examples being NXY-059 and haematopoietic growth factors which fulfilled nearly all the STAIR criteria"}
{"context":"Protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta) is essential for T cell activation, as it is required for the activation of NF-kappaB and expression of IL-2. PKCtheta has also been shown to affect NFAT activation and Th2 differentiation. To better understand the role of PKCtheta in the regulation of T helper cells, we used PKCtheta-deficient DO11.10 transgenic T cells to study its role in vitro. DO11.10 Th1 cells deficient in PKCtheta produced significantly less TNF-alpha and IL-2. The expression of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-24 was significantly reduced in PKCtheta-deficient T cells. Moreover, the expression of the Th2 transcription factor, GATA3, was significantly reduced in PKCtheta-deficient T cells. Overexpression of GATA3 by retroviral infection in PKCtheta-deficient T cells resulted in increased expansion of IL-4-producing T cells and higher IL-4 production than that of wild type Th2 cells. IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-24 expressions were also rescued by GATA3 overexpression. Our observations suggest that PKCtheta regulates Th2 cytokine expression via GATA3.","question":"What is the role of Gata3 in Th2 cells?","answer":"Moreover, the expression of the Th2 transcription factor, GATA3, was significantly reduced in PKCtheta-deficient T cells."}
{"context":"Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival. Indeed, overexpression of mouse or human Dnmt1 in murine and human cell lines decreased clonogenicity. By frame-shift and deletion constructs, this effect of mouse Dnmt1 was localized at the N-terminal 124 amino acid domain, which mediates interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Mutation of the PCNA-binding site restored normal cloning efficiencies. Overexpression of Dnmt3A or Dnmt3B, which do not interact with PCNA, yielded weaker effects on clonogenicity. Following introduction of the toxic domain, no significant effects on apoptosis, replication, or overall DNA methylation were observed for up to 3 d. Suppression of clonogenicity by Dnmt1 was also observed in cell lines lacking wild-type p53, p21(CIP1), or p16(INK4A). Suppression of clonogenicity by Dnmt1 overexpression may act as a fail-safe mechanism against carcinogenicity of sustained Dnmt1 overexpression.","question":"Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?","answer":"Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival."}
{"context":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition is a well- characterized treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this model-based meta-analysis was to describe the time course of HbA1c response after dosing with alogliptin (ALOG), saxagliptin (SAXA), sitagliptin (SITA), or vildagliptin (VILD). Publicly available data involving late-stage or marketed DPP-4 inhibitors were leveraged for the analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed to describe the relationship between DPP-4 inhibition and mean response over time. Plots of the relationship between metrics of DPP-4 inhibition (ie, weighted average inhibition [WAI], time above 80% inhibition, and trough inhibition) and response after 12 weeks of daily dosing were evaluated. The WAI was most closely related to outcome, although other metrics performed well. A model was constructed that included fixed effects for placebo and drug and random effects for intertrial variability and residual error. The relationship between WAI and outcome was nonlinear, with an increasing response up to 98% WAI. Response to DPP-4 inhibitors could be described with a single drug effect. The WAI appears to be a useful index of DPP-4 inhibition related to HbA1c. Biomarker to response relationships informed by model-based meta-analysis can be leveraged to support study designs including optimization of dose, duration of therapy, and patient population.","question":"What are 'vildagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'alogliptin', 'linagliptin', and 'dutogliptin'?","answer":"The objective of this model-based meta-analysis was to describe the time course of HbA1c response after dosing with alogliptin (ALOG), saxagliptin (SAXA), sitagliptin (SITA), or vildagliptin (VILD).

{"context":"Preischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia. In the present experiment, we studied the effects of preischemic hyperglycemia on protein markers that are related to mitochondrial fission and fusion, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy in mice subjected to 30-min transient focal ischemia. The fission proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and fission 1 (Fis1), fusion proteins optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), mitochondrial biogenesis regulators nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), and autophagy marker beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) were analyzed in control, 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus 6-, 24-, and 72 h of reperfusion in normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. Cerebral ischemia increased the levels of Drp1 and decreased Fis1 after reperfusion. Preischemic hyperglycemia further augmented the increase of Drp1 and induced elevation in Fis1. Ischemia inhibited the levels of Opa1 and Mfn2 and hyperglycemia further decreased the level of Opa1. Further, NRF1 increased after reperfusion in both normo- and hyperglycemic animals. However, such increase was caused by reperfusion rather than glucose level. Finally, ischemia increased beclin 1 level at 6 and 24 h of reperfusion and hyperglycemia further increased the beclin 1 level and caused LC3-II increase as well. Hyperglycemia enhances the ischemia-induced mitochondrial dynamic imbalance towards fission that may favor mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent damage. Hyperglycemia elevated autophagy markers may represent an adapting reaction to the severe damage incurred in hyperglycemic animals or a third pathway of cell death.","question":"List markers for autophagy.","answer":"autophagy marker beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) were analyzed in control, "}

{"context":"This study determines the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on post-infarction left ventricular (LV) remodeling and cardiac function. In mice, on day 1 after myocardial infarction (MI), HGF (0.45 mg\/kg per day) was injected into the tail vein for 7 days (n = 12). In the control mice (n = 12), 0.9% sodium chloride was injected instead of HGF. Hemodynamic data were obtained in vehicle treated control and HGF-treated hearts 4 weeks after the onset of MI. In the HGF-treated group, cardiac function was well preserved as indicated by LV pressure-volume relationship. These mice exhibited better LV systolic and diastolic function. The infarcted LV wall in HGF-treated heart was thicker as compared to vehicle treated group. Fibrosis and infarct size of the ventricular wall was significantly reduced in the HGF-treated hearts. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) and Ki67 positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the border area of the HGF-treated infarcted hearts. c-Met and c-kit positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the border area and epicardium. Angiogenesis was significantly enhanced in HGF-treated hearts as determined by vessel density per unit area. A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. Treatment with HGF improved heart function through angiogenesis, ventricular wall thickening, and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase\/Akt pathway.","question":"Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?","answer":"The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase\/Akt pathway."}
